         <abstract>
            <p>This paper analyses the fiscal pressure from population ageing using an intertemporal CGE model, applied to Australia, and compares the results with those of a recent government-commissioned study. The latter study uses an alternative modelling approach based on extrapolation rather than optimising behaviour of consumers and firms. The deadweight losses from the fiscal pressure caused by population ageing are equivalent to an annual loss of consumption of $260 per person per year in 2003 dollars in the balanced-budget scenario. A feasible degree of tax smoothing would reduce this welfare loss by an equivalent of $70 per person per year. Unlike the extrapolation-based model, the CGE approach takes account of feedback effects of ageing-induced tax increases on consumption and labour supply, which in turn impact on the ultimate magnitude of fiscal pressure and therefore tax increases. However, a counterfactual simulation suggests that the difference in terms of deadweight losses between the two modelling approaches is modest, at about $30 per person per year.</p>

This is not to say that the extrapolation approach is inferior. The fact that it lacks behavioural
foundations may be seen by some as a strength, rather than a weakness, on the basis that an extrapolation
of past trends is at least as reliable as a guide to the future as one based on assumptions about behaviour
that may be inaccurate.</mixed-citation>

In PC (2005), the increase in government spending on pensions is projected to be only 1.7 per cent of
GDP from 2004 to 2045, compared with an increase of 6 per cent through health and aged care. The
relatively small impact of ageing on public pension spending in Australia is due to its compulsory private
pension system combined with means testing of the public pension.</mixed-citation>

Lower labour force growth implies less demand for capital for a given capital-labour ratio, therefore
allowing a higher consumption share of output.</mixed-citation>

We constrain the tax rate on capital income to be equal to the tax rate on labour income. This is
important later when we discuss tax smoothing where the government chooses an optimal tax rate. In that
case, the choice refers to the choice of the labour income tax rate; the capital income tax rate is
constrained to be equal to that rate. This is done for simplicity in order to abstract from the problem of
choosing the optimal tax rate on capital. Floden (2003) employs a somewhat similar assumption. For a
discussion of the optimal tax rate on capital, see Chamley (1986).</mixed-citation>

This is simply the open-economy analogue to the Solow effect, which refers to the capital-widening
effects of employment growth on investment - in particular, slower employment growth lowers
investment and therefore allows higher consumption as a share of output.</mixed-citation>

The Solow effect in the open economy applies not just to capital, K, but to wealth defined as K-D.
Lower employment growth means that there are fewer new workers available to saddle with new debt
financed by consumption. This restricts consumption.</mixed-citation>

The calculation is done by comparing the optimal consumption paths under the counterfactual and

The optimal tax rate is not exactly constant because it must vary slightly in order to smooth the
relative price of leisure which implies smoothing the after-tax real wage (Floden, 2003; Andersen and
Dogonowski, 2004).</mixed-citation>
