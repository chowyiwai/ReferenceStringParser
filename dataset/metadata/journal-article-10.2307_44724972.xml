            <p>A USAF F-15B has been modified by McDonnell Aircraft Company to serve as a technology demonstrator aircraft for the Integrated Flight and Fire Control (IFFC) flight test program now being conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center. This paper discusses: (1) the need for technology demonstrator aircraft, ( 2) the selection of aircraft to be utilized as demonstrators, and (3) the modification and utilization of a technology demonstrator. The IFFC demonstration aircraft is used as an example to illustrate some of the key points of this paper. The modifications made on this aircraft to install the Integrated Flight and Fire Control system are briefly discussed, which serves to show the degree of complexity of the system to be evaluated. Other modifications to this aircraft were made which provide for an onboard Instrumentation System (IS) and Video System (VS), and these are discussed in greater detail. It is the data gathering and recording capabilities which provides the means for acquiring the quantitative results needed in engineering evaluations. A new and unique feature of the IFFC technology demonstrator aircraft is the introduction and use of an Onboard Simulation (OBS) system. The OBS provides a new tool for IFFC system development as well as pilot training and is easily expandable to other applications. Details of the OBS concept and its application to the IFFC I program are presented. This novel capability has the potential for application in both tactical aircraft systems and technology demonstrator aircraft. The IFFC aircraft, outfitted with the IS, the VS, and the OBS, has an inherent growth potential to continue to serve as a viable technology demonstrator, for numerous future advanced programs which are now in the planning stages, with minimal need for hardware modification.</p>
