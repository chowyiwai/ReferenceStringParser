         <abstract>
            <p>We investigate the determinants of the pattern of Islamic bank expansion around the world using country-level data for 1992–2006. The analysis illustrates that income per capita, share of Muslims in the population, and economic integration with Middle Eastern countries are linked to the development of Islamic banking. Interest rates have a negative impact, while the quality of institutions is not found to be significant. The September 11, 2001, attacks were not a major factor in the expansion of Islamic banking, but they coincided with rising oil prices. Islamic banks also appear to be complements to, rather than substitutes for, conventional banks.</p>

Cihâk and Hesse (2008), however, find that Islamic banks tend to be less stable when op-
erating on a large scale. This suggests that, under certain conditions, a growing Islamic banking
sector might not be beneficial for economic growth if the growing Islamic banking sector weakens
financial stability in countries where a proper prudential regulation is lacking. This is contradicted
by Abedifar et al. (2013), who find that smaller banks are in fact more stable. It is probably fair
to say that banking systems that are diversified and include Islamic banks as a complement to
conventional banks are likely to be helpful for financial stability.</mixed-citation>

When they were first established, Shariah Supervisory Boards were extremely cautious in
their advice and sometimes even obstructive. In the last few years, they appear, according to some
experts, to have become less cautious in their interpretations.</mixed-citation>

The theoretical literature does not suggest that financial system development is affected by
the exchange rate choice. It is not clear, a priori, whether countries with fixed or floating exchange
rates would have more developed financial systems. We tested this proposition, but the exchange
rate variable was not statistically significant in explaining the diffusion of Islamic banking assets,
probably because most oil-producing countries and the majority of countries with Muslim popula-
tions in our sample have de facto pegged exchange rates.</mixed-citation>

The coefficient on income per capita might be biased if Islamic banking (as conventional
banking) in turn affects the level of development. However, the result of the endogeneity test does
not support this hypothesis.</mixed-citation>

One problem Islamic banks face is the lack of a single set of rules that governs Islamic
banking. Like Shariah law, rules are subject to interpretation and tend to change over time. Some
conservative Islamic scholars have concluded that investing in stock markets is a form of gambling
prohibited by the Quran. Others interpret the Quran to mean that they should not get involved in
day trading with the intention of selling the equity soon after for a profit.</mixed-citation>
