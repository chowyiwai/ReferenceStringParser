         <abstract>
            <p>We show that name-induced stereotypes affect the investment choices of U.S. mutual fund investors. Managers with foreign-sounding names have about 10% lower annual fund flows, and this effect is stronger among funds with investor clienteles more likely to be suspicious of foreigners. Foreign-named managers experience lower appreciation (greater decline) in flows following good (bad) performance. Following 9/11, flows to funds with managers with Middle-Eastern-sounding names declined abnormally. In an experimental setting in which skill differences are absent, individuals allocate 11% less money to an index fund managed by a foreign-named manager. This gap widens following the Boston marathon bombings.</p>

A growing number of studies in economics and psychology use AMT (e.g., Horton, Rand, and Zeckhauser
2011; Amir, Rand, and Gal 2012; Chandler and Kapelner 2013; Goodman, Cryder, and Cheema 2013). To our

Our full sample results are not driven by September 2001 alone. In fact, our results are most consistent with a
permanent negative effect on the perceptions of Middle Eastern foreigners. This finding is consistent with survey
evidence from the Gallup poll as reported by Margulies (2013), suggesting that U.S. citizens have a progressively
less favorable view of Islam from 2001 until today.</mixed-citation>

More specifically, their findings suggest that the overall positive relation between churchgoing and strength of
ethnic prejudice is driven mainly by to those churchgoers with an extrinsic motivation, that is individuals "disposed
to use religion for their own ends." Their evidence also suggests that intrinsically motivated churchgoers, that is
individuals who "find their master motive in religion," are often less prejudiced.</mixed-citation>

One potential alternative interpretation of our location-based results is that the geographical patterns we
observe reflect taste-based discrimination at the fund management company level. Such a management company
discrimination channel, if it exists, would further strengthen our argument that flow differences are induced by
taste-based discrimination and complement the investor channel. However, because the flow results are robust
to including fund family fixed effects, it is not entirely obvious how an alternative channel would operate.</mixed-citation>

If we require 75% of all workers to define a fund as foreign, as in our main flow-based tests, only 1.64% fund
managers and 0.85% of all observations in the brokerage sample are associated with foreign funds. Even with this
small sample of observations associated with managers with foreign-sounding names, we find that the coefficient
estimates of the Foreign75 variable in Table 8, panel A, remain significant. The Foreign75 coefficient estimates in
the inflow, outflow, and net flow columns are â0.802 (/-statistic = â4.64), 1.312 (/-statistic =6.82), and â1.677
(/-statistic = -3.07), respectively. In panel B, the main coefficient estimates have similar signs, but they lose their
statistical significance.</mixed-citation>

The threat of a lawsuit is more than a theoretical possibility. For example, in 2008, Texas-based American State
Bank agreed to pay $225,000 to settle allegations of the Department of Labor that the bank engaged in hiring
discrimination against minority applicants. American State Bank claims that the Department of Labor's decision
was based solely on a "statistical shortfall in hiring of minority applicants for office and clerical positions" even
though "[...] no employee, applicant, or any other person actually complained of discrimination or wrongdoing
by American State Bank." Source: http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=8373627&amp;nav=menu69_l_4.</mixed-citation>

As an example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203, Â§342) contains
new diversity requirements for federal agencies involved in the financial sector, as well as the businesses that
deal with those agencies. Specifically, each contractor doing business with an agency is required to submit a
written statement indicating that it has "ensure[d], to the maximum extent possible, the fair inclusion of women
and minorities in [its] workforce... and, as applicable, [the workforce of] subcontractors."</mixed-citation>
