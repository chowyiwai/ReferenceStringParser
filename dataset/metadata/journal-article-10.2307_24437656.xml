         <abstract>
            <p>This paper provides a non-technical review of the evidence on the returns to education and training for the individual, the firm and the economy at large. It begins by reviewing the empirical work that has attempted to estimate the true causal effect of education and training on individual earnings, focusing on the recent literature that has attempted to control for potential biases in the estimated returns to education and training. It then moves on to review the literature that has looked at the returns from human capital investments to employers. Lack of suitable data and methodological difficulties have resulted in a paucity of studies that have carried out sound empirical work on this issue. In the final part of the review, we look at the work that has tried to assess the contribution of human capital to national economic growth at the macroeconomic level. This work has generally involved using either a 'growth accounting' theoretical framework or 'new growth' theories. Although the empirical macroeconomic evidence that accompanies this work does not generally allow one to distinguish between the two approaches, there is a substantial body of evidence on the contribution of education to economic growth.</p>

The standard economic model concentrates on the quantifiable economic costs and benefits of these
investments. Thus these models ignore the unquantifiable benefits an individual obtains from undertaking
education — for example, the pleasure derived from learning and/or the non-financial advantages of working in
a skilled profession.</mixed-citation>

It should be noted that, while in the human capital approach it is the investment in education that enhances the
productive potential of the individual, a competing paradigm — the 'screening hypothesis' — views
educational qualifications as being simply used as a mechanism for selecting individuals who are inherently
more productive.</mixed-citation>

Although this is generally true, some studies report considerably higher estimates — for example, 15 per cent
by Harmon and Walker (1995) for the UK. As Card (1999) argues, this is probably due to the fact that the
returns to education vary among different groups of individuals (i.e. are heterogeneous). The estimation
procedure used by Harmon and Walker (1995) may only identify an estimate for a particular sub-group of the
UK population (those forced to stay on at school after changes to the compulsory leaving age in the UK). There
are strong economic arguments why this return may well exceed the average return to education for the
population as a whole.</mixed-citation>

See Blundell et al. (1997) and Dearden (1999). As these studies use data from the 1970s and 1980s, it is likely
that these returns for women are an overestimate, for although overall returns to education have not fallen back
over this period, the differential between men and women by education group has fallen over time.</mixed-citation>

solving, decision-making, written and oral communication, improvement of job performance and stress

Standard economic theory distinguishes training according to its portability between firms. The two polar
forms are specific training and general training, the latter generating extremely versatile skills, equally usable or
saleable in any other firm that might employ the worker concerned. A standard result based on the general-
specific distinction concerns training finance. General training will not be financed by the firm due to the risk
of its training investment being poached away by other firms; hence it is the workers receiving general training
who will bear the cost of it, either directly or in the form of reduced wages during the training period. As for
firm-specific training, the firm may be willing to fund part of its costs, while reaping part of its benefits.</mixed-citation>

An important qualification is, in fact, that the results of these studies may indeed point to an overall lower
productivity of the British plants studied, but not necessarily lower profitability. Lower-skilled workers in the
UK are not generally paid as much as their continental counterparts (because of relatively low unemployment
benefits and the absence of a minimum wage). It may thus be far more profitable and efficient for British firms
to employ more of these lower-skilled workers. Furthermore, if high-technology equipment is complementary
with highly-skilled labour, it being easier for more-educated workers to adapt to new technological capital
equipment efficiently, and if the average skill level of hires is too low, firms in the UK may simply find it not
optimal to train workers to a high enough level to allow them to use the new capital equipment profitably. The
ensuing socially inefficient low-skill, low-technology equilibrium may thus be optimal from the firm's point of
view.</mixed-citation>

Formal training received on the job from a previous employer has no effect on the starting wage but increases
initial productivity by 9.5 per cent of the wage while at the same time reducing training requirements by 17 per
cent. Formal off-the-job training sponsored by a previous employer does not increase current wage rates but
boosts productivity, thus increasing profitability by 14 per cent of the wage at six months of tenure and by 18.6
per cent of the wage at the time of the survey interview — Bishop ( 1994).</mixed-citation>
