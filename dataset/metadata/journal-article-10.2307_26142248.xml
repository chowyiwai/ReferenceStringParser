         <abstract>
            <p>Local stock markets adjust sluggishly to changes in local inflation. When the local rate of inflation increases, local investors subsequently earn lower real returns on local stocks, but not on local bonds or foreign stocks, suggesting that local stock market investors use sticky long-run nominal discount rates that are too low when inflation increases because they are slow to update the inflation expectations in discount rates. Small amounts of stickiness in inflation expectations suffice to match the real stock return predictability induced by inflation in the data. We also consider other explanations, such as nominal cash flow extrapolation.</p>

In addition, career concerns give bond managers a strong incentive to spend some bandwidth on monitoring
inflation, because inflation forecast errors would differentially effect bond portfolios. Not so for stock portfolios.
Our evidence is also consistent with the findings of other researchers who study the effect of macroeconomic
announcements on asset prices: Rigobon and Sack (2006) document large, instantaneous effects of monetary
policy innovations on yields in bond markets, and smaller, muted effects on valuations in stock markets.</mixed-citation>

While sticky prices in product markets can explain incomplete pass-through of surprise inflation to nominal

It follows that lagged inflation may no longer be a good measure of expected inflation over this sample. In
Online Appendix H, we use survey measures of 1 -year expected inflation instead of lagged inflation, and we find

Aggregated across all firms i, these nominal cash flow projections naturally imply an expected future path for
aggregate inflation when combined with real cash flow projections. However, most investors do not attack this

Duffee (2014) computes that news about expected inflation over the life of the bond only account for 10% to 20%
of the shocks to Treasury yields, leaving stocks to real rates and term premiums to account for the rest. Surely, for
stocks, this fraction is an order of magnitude smaller, because stocks are claims to real cash flows. In addition,
recomputing the appropriate nominal discount rates when expected inflation changes to reprice the nominal cash
flows of stocks is not an easy task. Simply computing the actual duration of stocks is hard. Repricing nominal
bonds when expected inflation changes is simple by comparison. As a result, a fraction of stock market investors
may rationally decide not to continuously reprice stocks, given a limited capacity to process information, simply
because inflation innovations account for a small fraction of total stock return variation, but they account for a
much larger fraction of bond return variation.</mixed-citation>

However, looking at the U.S. experience, Milani (2007) concludes that agents who use adaptive learning would
have underestimated inflation persistence until the early 1980s. The perceived degree of persistence then declines
again, only to increase in the 1990s. In the baseline panel, the stock return spread between the lowest and the
highest quintile is smallest or even switches signs in the 1980s, consistent with the notion that persistence cpr
was too low around the world in the 1950s and 1960s, and finally was about right in the 1980s.</mixed-citation>

Piazzesi and Schneider (2006) show that a negative correlation between expected inflation and future real
consumption growth, a feature of the U.S. data, delivers upward sloping nominal yield curves in a standard
representative agent dynamic equilibrium model. Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013) extend a version of this model
to match moments of bond, stock and currency returns by introducing uncertainty about inflation as an additional
state variable. Nakamura et al. (2013) find evidence of inflation spikes during consumption disasters. There is an
older literature on this topic. Fama (1981) originally proposed a proxy explanation of the negative correlation
between expected inflation and stock returns in the U.S. time series. Fama conjectures that there is a negative
relation between the future growth of real activity and the level of expected inflation, as well as a positive
correlation between the future growth and expected real stock returns, thus giving rise to a negative correlation
between inflation expectations and expected real returns. Geske and Roll (1983) developed a reverse causation
version of this argument.</mixed-citation>

A central tenet of modern asset pricing is that the price of risk is counter-cyclical (see Campbell and Cochrane
1999). There is plenty of empirical evidence to support this notion (see Lettau and Ludvigson 2002, Lustig
and Verdelhan 2012). In this class of models, expected returns on stocks invariably increase in bad times, when
marginal utility growth is high. That delivers a negative covariance between realized stock returns and the pricing
kernel, the key to a positive equity premium.</mixed-citation>

In a related strand of the literature, Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe (2002,2009) develop a Baumol-Tobin model with
endogenously segmented markets. Investors incur a fixed costs when participating in asset markets. An increase
in expected inflation increases the benefit of participation in asset markets and hence lowers risk premiums. If
inflation is sufficiently high, the neutrality of inflation is restored, in line with our findings for high inflation
countries. However, this Baumol-Tobin mechanism cannot explain the asymmetric effect of inflation on equity
and bond risk premiums.</mixed-citation>

Several authors have found additional evidence in support of the money illusion hypothesis. Campbell and
Vuolteenaho (2004) find that the level of inflation explains a large share of mispricing of the U.S. stock market,
consistent with the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis. In the cross-section of U.S. stocks, Cohen, Polk and Vuolteenaho
(2005) also find evidence that stock market investors are subject to money illusion, while Brunnermeier and
Julliard (2008) report similar evidence from U.S. housing markets. Piazzesi and Schneider (2008) develop an
equilibrium model in which real rate disagreement is driven by money illusion. Using survey data for earnings
forecasts and expected inflation, Sharpe (2002) attributes the negative correlation between equity valuations and
expected inflation to an increase in the required real return on stocks and a decrease in expected earnings growth
that coincide with a rise in expected inflation. In recent work, Bekaert and Engstrom (2010) attribute this U.S.
correlation to heightened uncertainty during times of higher expected inflation in the United States.</mixed-citation>
