Subsequently the Government modified the proposals to add a new 'Band H affecting property worth four or
more times the national average (£320,000 in England), which would face twice the bill for an average property
(Hansard, 23 July 1991, col. 1053). As will be apparent from the results presented in Section V, this change will
affect very few properties and will have little effect on the overall pattern of gains and losses from the new tax.</mixed-citation>

Gearing has become more extreme with the proposed Council Tax than it has been with the Community Charge
because of the reduced proportion of local spending financed through local taxation announced in the 1991 Budget.
In its final year, 1992-93, the Community Charge will be subject to similar gearing, although the proportionate
effect on the bills in different areas will not be the same.</mixed-citation>

Families are ranked by their net income under the Community Charge regime, after deduction of net Community
Charge. Their net incomes are 'equivalised' to take account of differences in family size and composition. For
instance, a single person with a net income of £ 100 per week is put in the same place in the distribution as a married
couple with one child and a net income of £200 per week.</mixed-citation>

Note that the revenue neutrality applies to the public sector as a whole, not to the gross revenue yield of each tax
to local government. This is because the different taxes imply different costs of rebates to central government.</mixed-citation>

Non-householder family units would either experience no change (for example because they are not liable to the
Community Charge) or would be measured as being better off since they would be liable to the Community Charge
but not the Council Tax. There are some 2.1 million such family units, and two-thirds of them would be gainers.
If one looks only at householders, there would be more losers (40 per cent) than gainers (35 per cent).</mixed-citation>

If the DoE's estimates (see Table 2) of the proportion of properties in Bands A and G (26 per cent) are more
accurate than ours (19 per cent), these could well be understated.</mixed-citation>
