         <abstract>
            <p>Transportation aspects of commercial spaceflight in the opening decades
                            of the Twenty-first Century are envisioned. A specific Spaceliner
                            concept is described, one predicated on combined-cycle
                            airbreathing/rocket("Synerjet") propulsion. Its technical literature
                            recorded heritage is reviewed. NASA's long-term goals, and its ongoing
                            program relevant to this class of transportation concepts are
                            discussed. A key observation, one of potentially distant, but great significance to
                            the future of aviation and the air carrier industry, is that Spaceliner
                            class systems, once available, can -- in addition to providing orbital
                            payload service -- fly transglobally, conducting point-to-point
                            terrestrial transportation services, all at 'highest speed." Providing
                            an aviation/air-carrier perspective on all of this, in an annex paper
                            attached, the candid views of an esteemed former airlines executive, the
                            late Willis Player, are highlighted.</p>
