         <abstract>
            <p>Recently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a final rule [1] for a new safety standard related to child safety seats and their anchorage systems in vehicles. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 225 - "Child Restraint Systems; Child Restraint Anchorage Systems" requires that motor vehicle manufacturers provide a new method for installing child restraints using anchorage systems that are standardized and independent of the vehicle seat belts. The new standard was developed because it is recognized that the full effectiveness of child restraint systems is not being realized due to design features affecting the compatibility of child restraints with vehicle seating and seat belt systems. By requiring an easy-touse anchorage system that is independent of the vehicle seat belts, the NHTSA believes that the final rule makes possible more effective child restraint installation and will thereby increase child restraint effectiveness and child safety. Over the next few years, vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, and child seat manufacturers will be phasing-in new designs which meet the FMVSS 225 requirements. As part of this effort, current testing apparatus and new procedures will have to be developed and/or upgraded in order to conduct these evaluations. This paper overviews FMVSS 225 requirements and the equipment which is used to conduct these evaluations. Readers of this paper will gain a much broader understanding of FMVSS 225 and the effects that this rule will have on future vehicle and child seat designs.</p>
