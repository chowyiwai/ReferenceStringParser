         <abstract>
            <p>The rapid and accurate measurement of internally threaded holes is one of today's more difficult measurement problems. QUEST Integrated, Inc., has built an electro-optic based internal/external thread measurement system. It measures internal thread sizes from 9 to 150 mm (3/8 to 6 inches) and may be inserted up to 75 mm (3 inches) deep. This is the first system capable of measuring the simple pitch diameters of internal thread forms. It also measures lead, flank angles, major, and minor diameters. The non-contact method of the QC-30 Thread Measurement System enables in-process inspection by eliminating touch labor. It can measure blind holes, master gages, and production parts. The system works by calibrating to a master gage. It then scans other parts and fits a 3D thread model to the data. Inspection results are presented both numerically and graphically. The most commonly used methods for inspecting threaded parts are based on mechanical contacting gages. The simplest of these is the go/no-go gauge, a ring or plug that checks for assembly. Go/no-go gauges wear quickly and must be set for both the size and the tolerance of each threaded fastener. They have limited repeatability since they depend on the operator's judgment of the snugness of fit. There are a variety of other indicating gauges all of which rely on multiple point contacts at different locations on the threaded surface. Results from measuring the same parameter on gauges of different types or from different manufacturers may not be consistent. Relatively consistent results can be obtained if the parts to be measured are near their nominal tolerance. However, if there is any form error in manufacturing the part, consistent results are difficult to obtain (Veale et al., 1994). There has been no technology to accurately and traceably measure flank angle and lead directly (Greenslade, 1991).</p>
