         <abstract>
            <p>This paper presents an empirical investigation of costs associated with four major restructurings in the North American steel industry over the past decade. In contrast to many previous studies which concentrated mainly on the impact of restructuring on shareholders and bondholders, this study considers the losses suffered by all stakeholders of the four sample firms. The stakeholders examined include labor, suppliers, unsecured creditors, and government agencies in addition to the debtholders and preferred and common shareholders. The study also examines the administrative and legal costs associated with restructurings. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the wealth losses suffered by all stakeholders and to conduct a longitudinal analysis of these restructurings in order to evaluate the relative magnitude of these wealth losses. The combined losses suffered by all stakeholders in the four restructurings analyzed in this paper are estimated at approximately $7 billion. These four restructuring cases exemplify the restructuring issues in an industry which, at its peak, employed close to 550,000 and was considered to be one of the most important industries in North America. These restructurings reflect the impact of five major threats to the steel industry in the 1980s, including the introduction of labor-saving technology, overseas imports, competition from substitute materials such as plastics, overall slow economic growth, and the emergence of superefficient mini-mills. The four restructurings studied are: Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation (WPSC), LTV Steel, Weirton Steel, and Algoma Steel. WPSC (1985) and LTV (1986) represent cases where the firms filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; Weirton (1984) represents an employee buyout using the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) arrangement allowed under the United States Tax Code; and Algoma Steel (1991) represents a recent Canadian case where the company applied for protection under the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act (Canada). In the latter two cases, the major players were the parent firms whose shareholders and debtholders indirectly suffered the losses incurred by these parent companies (the actual amount of these indirect losses could not be determined). WPSC emerged from Chapter 11 in 1991; Weirton and Algoma are operating under the ownership of their employees; at the time of completion of this paper, LTV was still under Chapter 11. This paper is based on data from various sources, including year-end reports, plans of restructuring, interviews with company officials, and newspaper and magazine articles. Our analysis and results indicate that previous studies may have significantly underestimated the total wealth losses associated with restructuring. As the nonshareholder losses are found to be significant, it can be argued that these stakeholders may wish to be more vigilant about the impact of labor and capital structure decisions on the company's well-being. Although individual cases provide different situations, circumstances, and degrees of complexity, certain generalizable conclusions emerge. First, the estimates of shareholders' losses depend on assumptions about the time period for the estimation. If shareholders' losses are computed based on the period immediately surrounding the announcement of restructuring, these losses are not very large in relation to those suffered by other stakeholders. Not surprisingly, extending the period prior to the announcement by one year indicates a higher degree of losses. Second, notwithstanding the wealth losses suffered by shareholders, losses suffered by other stakeholders are also significant and, at times, considerably higher than those incurred by shareholders. Third, shareholders' contribution to the overall restructuring process is not very significant if compared to contributions by the other stakeholders. Fourth, concessions made by labor and other nonshareholders have a significant positive impact on the health of the company in the period following the initiation of the restructuring procedure. Fifth, in the case of the three U.S. companies, government concessions and assistance were significant and imply an indirect and negative wealth impact on the average U.S. taxpayer. An analysis of the post-bankruptcy period indicates that the operating and financial performance of the sample firms improved in the post-restructuring period. The major reasons for this improvement in the performance were the wage concessions made by labor and the suspension of interest payments to both secured and unsecured debtholders. There are also some indications that the overall productivity of these firms also improved in the post-bankruptcy period. It is, of course, impossible to compare this performance to the performance that would have been achieved had these firms not undergone the restructuring process. In any event, this improvement in the overall performance and the resulting increase in company profits allowed labor to recoup some of the wage concessions through the participation in profit-sharing arrangements negotiated during the restructuring process.</p>
