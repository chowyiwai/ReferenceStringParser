         <abstract>
            <p>Nissan's new 2.4-liter in-line, 4-cylinder gasoline engine, the "KA24E," was developed for the worldwide automobile market, but exclusively for the North American market. It has been released for Nissan's new 1989 model, highperformance sports car, the "240SX", and will also be mounted in such forthcoming models as the new 1990 "AXXESS". The major objectives in developing this new engine were to achieve high performance at practical driving speeds, especially at low-and middle-engine speeds, quiet engine operation, reliability, fuel economy and serviceability, all of which are essential factors in daily driving. For realizing these objectives, multivalves, aerodynamic intake ports, a high-rigidity cylinder block, a silent single timing chain, and hydraulic valve lash adjusters were incorporated into this engine. Furthermore, to develop the engine, almost all components were redesigned using computer design techniques, and checked by extensive testing. Regarding performance, with the aid of an efficient multi-point injection system (Nissan's ECCS), results confirmed smooth, powerful acceleration from a standing start, smooth response, and more than adequate power for passing at highway speeds. This paper discusses the major development objectives, the basic engine structure, and principal component parts of the KA24E.</p>
