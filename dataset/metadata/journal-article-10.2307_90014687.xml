            <label>Abstract</label>
            <p>This study focuses on how Spanish teachers in four different rural US high schools use computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in their classrooms, and the nature of the relationship between their use of CALL and their experience of learning about CALL. A situated learning framework was used to evaluate the teachers’ learning opportunities in light of their CALL implementation. Teacher interviews, classroom observations, and class documents and websites suggested that the teachers rarely altered their pedagogy or their curriculum to integrate technology. Crucial elements of a situated learning environment were missing, and they corresponded to areas where teachers’ usage was not consistent with CALL principles. The study concludes with implications for practitioners, researchers, and theorists.</p>
