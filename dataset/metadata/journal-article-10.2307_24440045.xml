         <abstract>
            <p>This paper identifies the relevant determinants of a company's effective tax burden. Thereby, we account for bilateral aspects of corporate taxation by calculating bilateral effective tax rates as proposed by Devereux and Griffith (1999 and 2003). The empirical evidence of a large panel of nearly 8,000 bilateral effective tax rates within the OECD suggests that country size is an important determinant of the effective tax rate. In line with the literature, bilateral tax rates with small host countries exhibit a smaller overall effective tax rate, despite the fact that larger countries are more likely to reduce the tax burden by means of tax treaties at the bilateral level. Further, we find that geographically remote countries impose higher taxes, whereas economic integration tends to reduce the extent of the bilateral effective tax burden.</p>

There are various other measures of economic integration, most notably the globalisation indices of
Dreher (2006) and Lockwood and Redoano (2005). However, as these indices are not available for the
full sample, we follow the literature (e.g. Grubert and Mutti, 2000; Devereux, Griffith and Klemm, 2002)
and use openness to trade as a proxy for economic integration.</mixed-citation>

This approach follows Egger (2000). Alternatively, the remoteness variable could be constructed as
GDP-weighted average distance, proposed by Egger and Winner (2004). However, as the coefficient for
the remoteness variable then additionally measures the size and growth of geographically close
neighbours, we choose the specification without weights to obtain a clearer prediction.</mixed-citation>

It should be noted that various measures of tax burden exist. We choose the bilateral EATR and

investment. See Sdrensen (2004) for an excellent survey about the measurement of the tax burden.</mixed-citation>

The underlying assumption for debt financing is a loan from the parent company. Therefore, interest
