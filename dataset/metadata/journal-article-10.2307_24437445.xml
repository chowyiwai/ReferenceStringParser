         <abstract>
            <p>Building on previous work, this paper documents the changes in income inequality that have occurred over the past 20 years, right up until the late 1990s. In particular, we are interested in whether or not the path of inequality in the most recent economic cycle differed from that observed in the 1980s. The robustness of the results is investigated using innovative statistical techniques, in an attempt to identify whether or not the observed changes represent real increases or decreases in inequality or whether they can be attributed simply to sampling variation between years. Finally, some preliminary results are presented which attempt to identify some of the reasons underlying the observed trends in income inequality, with a particular focus on the role of the labour market.</p>

The income on which the calculation of COV is based differs slightly from the BHC definition: it is gross of
certain payments, such as maintenance payments and council tax. This allows a more meaningful
decomposition of inequality into different sources of income, which we utilise in Section V. Following the
methodology of Goodman, Johnson and Webb (1997), we have excluded those with zero incomes from the
analysis. This does not affect the general pattern of the results.</mixed-citation>

0f course, the data on which these inequality measures are based come from cross-section surveys, and the
compositions of the poorest and richest groups change over time. As a result, the interpretation of statements
such as 'the poor have got poorer' must be tempered by the recognition that we are not necessarily comparing
like with like.</mixed-citation>
