         <abstract>
            <p>Beginning with the contract relations with their customers, the author outlines the procedure for production planning, purchase control and wage payments at the Anderson factory of the Delco-Remy Corporation. Working on the basis of monthly schedules, instead of annual contracts for definite quantities, has made possible a great increase in rate of turning over material. Many wages are paid on a group premium basis, a modification of the Bedaux system, that has proved very satisfactory and adaptable where operations are not distinct or independent enough for individual premium wages. Several such groups are described. The discussion, which was almost all on wage payments and allied subjects, brought out one instance in which men had produced even more than the theoretical capacity of their machines. Wage premiums for foremen, inspectors, toolmakers and tool designers came in for discussion. American flags are made more effective than gear guards in preventing accidents. Boys and men are being trained for greater usefulness, mostly in cooperation with the local high school and various colleges.</p>
