         <abstract>
            <p>The treatment of housing is one of the most difficult issues under the VATs in the EU. Ideally, rents and rental values should be taxed just like other consumer goods and services, but doing so would present formidable practical and political difficulties. Under a second-best approach, the value of newly created residential (and other) property is taxed as a proxy for the VAT that should be payable on the flow of housing (building) services. This implies, however, that future increases (and decreases) in the value of the exempt property are left out of the VAT base. To remedy this defect, this paper recommends taxing the increases (refunding the tax related to decreases) realised at the time of sale of the exempt used property. This VAT should replace the current transfer, registration and stamp duties, which are highly distortionary. Beyond that, the VATs in various member states can be improved by limiting the exemption for all used immovable property to housing, by taxing land and by applying the standard rate more widely than is currently the case.</p>

It is quite another matter that land is not a produced input - that its supply is fixed (except perhaps in
Holland), so that taxing land ownership is taxing an economic rent (Mirrlees et al., 2011, chapter 16).
Accordingly, the tax would be capitalised in the value of the land without any effect on economic activity.
But this feature calls for a separate land or land value tax, not a VAT. Under a VAT, the tax on land
would be washed out if the land is used for taxable activities by taxable persons, but not if used or owned
by non-taxable persons.</mixed-citation>

The rationale for taxing rental values under the income tax runs parallel to that under a pure VAT.
Rather than earning a return on his house in the market, on which he would be taxed, the owner-occupier
offers the return to himself as investor, which should be included in his income tax assessment. Taxing
this return under the income tax as well as the VAT is not a form of double taxation, just as the
application of the VAT to the consumption of a market-earned rental charge, on which income tax has
been paid, is not considered double taxation. The application of both taxes arises because owner-occupied
houses are an investment as well as a consumption good.</mixed-citation>

Elsewhere, the Australian states impose stamp duty on the transfer of immovable property,
differentiated by state, property category (principal residences may attract reduced rates) and purchase
price. There is no link between the federal VAT and the state stamp duty. A study by the Property
Council of Australia (2003) concluded that the abolition of stamp duty on leases would be highly
desirable. In Canada, most provinces impose land transfer taxes, often at graduated rates. New Zealand
does not levy transfer or stamp duties.</mixed-citation>

These schemes enable farmers to charge VAT on their sales at a rate approximately equivalent to
their average total input tax as a percentage of turnover, obviating the need for filing and payment of tax
(Germany), or they provide for a presumptive tax credit to purchasers of farm output, again
approximately equivalent to the VAT on farmers' inputs (the Netherlands). For more on these schemes,

Conrad (2010) believes that VAT should be levied on the selling price and that a credit should be
allowed for the inflation-adjusted VAT on the purchase price, but this appears difficult to reconcile with
the cash-flow nature of the VAT. For more details on this 'S-tax' ('s' for 'stock'), see Conrad and Grozav
(2008).</mixed-citation>

These valuations are also used for income tax, municipal property tax and inheritance tax purposes.
The rental value of owner-occupied property is subject to the progressive income tax, but effective rates
are low because taxable rental values are computed using lower percentages applied to rated values than
would accord with arm's-length rates. Since mortgage interest is fully deductible, the income tax
treatment of rental values results in a sizeable net subsidy to homeowners.</mixed-citation>
