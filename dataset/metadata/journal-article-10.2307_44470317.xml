         <abstract>
            <p>The Bosch process is a promising technique for the reduction of the carbon dioxide (CO₂) removed from the Space Station atmosphere and the subsequent water formation for oxygen (O₂) recovery. The primary reasons are the elimination of on-board gaseous storage or overboard venting and the potential for 100% efficient (O₂) recovery. Several units utilizing the Bosch process, which catalytically reduces CO₂ with hydrogen (H₂) to solid carbon and water, have been built and operated during the past two decades. Each contributed substantially to the knowledge base which favorably affected subsequent designs. Proof of concept hardware at the breadboard level was primarily concerned with carbon control, materials durability and reliability of reaction initiation. Significant engineering feasibility testing for the Bosch process has been made in the first computer-controlled Bosch subsystem currently in operation at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) Test Chamber. Automatic process controls, such as reactor startup, switchover and fault detection have been successfully demonstrated. As the evolution of Bosch technology continues, optimizing power consumption, expendable weight, crew safety and compatibility with Space Station interfaces must be addressed. A man-rated prototype Bosch unit currently under fabrication for the NASA Technology Demonstrator Program will provide compliance with these issues. Additionally, increased cartridge life potential and lowered power consumption will result from advances made in catalyst types and configurations. The technology is at a state of maturity directly applicable to flight status for NASA's Space Station Program. This includes advances to be made for increased equipment reliability and maintainability, as well as meeting the requirements for launch conditions.</p>
