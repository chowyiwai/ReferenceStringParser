         <abstract>
            <p>IDS Financial Services (1990) stated its belief that 20 percent of current life insurers could become insolvent should a major economic downturn occur. This study examines the risk-adjusted return performance and systematic risk change (as measured by a firm's beta) of life insurance companies across various market conditions between 1973 and 1994. The results indicate that investors in life insurance company stocks earned positive risk-adjusted returns during the study time period, historically outperforming the market on a risk-adjusted basis. The systematic risk of life insurance stocks in a bear market is not statistically different from the market's risk level, and, moreover, the firm's risk level in a bull market is significantly less than in a bear market. In the most recent sub-period that we test (1990-1994), a life insurance firm's systematic risk level is significantly greater than that of the market; therefore, these firms may be more sensitive to general market conditions than they formerly were.</p>
