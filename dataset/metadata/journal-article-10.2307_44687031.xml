         <abstract>
            <p>Because of its abundance and because it offers significant energy and environmental advantages, natural gas has been promoted for use in motor vehicles. A number of transportation fuels are produced from natural gas; each is distinct in terms of upstream production activities and vehicle usage. In this paper, we present greenhouse gas emission impacts of using various natural gas-based transportation fuels. We include eight fuels — compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, hydrogen, dimethyl ether, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and electricity — for use in five types of motor vehicles — spark-ignition vehicles, compression-ignition vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, battery-powered electric vehicles, and fuel-cell vehicles. In our evaluation, we separate these fuels and vehicle technologies into near- and long-term options to address technology progress over time. Because of great uncertainties associated with advances in both fuel production and vehicle technologies, we establish both an "incremental technology scenario" and a "leap-forward technology scenario" to cover a range of potential technology improvements. Our study reveals that, in general, the use of natural gas-based fuels reduces greenhouse gas emissions relative to use of petroleumbased gasoline and diesel, although different fuels in different vehicle technologies can have significantly different emissions impacts.</p>
