         <abstract>
            <p>Online auctions have been the subject of many empirical research efforts in the fields of economics and information systems. These research efforts are often based on analyzing data from Web sites such as eBay.com which provide public information about sequences of bids in closed auctions, typically in the form of tables on HTML pages. The existing literature on online auctions focuses on tools like summary statistics and more formal statistical methods such as regression models. However, there is a clear void in this growing body of literature in developing appropriate visualization tools. This is quite surprising, given that the sheer amount of data that can be found on sites such as eBay.com is overwhelming and can often not be displayed informatively using standard statistical graphics. In this article we introduce graphical methods for visualizing online auction data in ways that are informative and relevant to the types of research questions that are of interest. We start by using profile plots that reveal aspects of an auction such as bid values, bidding intensity, and bidder strategies. We then introduce the concept of statistical zooming (STAT-zoom) which can scale up to be used for visualizing large amounts of auctions. STAT-zoom adds the capability of looking at data summaries at various time scales interactively. Finally, we develop auction calendars and auction scene visualizations for viewing a set of many concurrent auctions. The different visualization methods are demonstrated using data on multiple auctions collected from eBay.com.</p>
