         <abstract>
            <p>This paper assesses the distributional impact of indirect taxes among Greek households between 1988 and 2002, a period that coincides with the introduction of significant reforms in the tax system due to EU membership. The highly differentiated indirect tax structure prevailing at the beginning of the period had distributional benefits over the more simplified 2002 tax structure. The overall inequality of the after-tax welfare distribution has increased by 6–12½ per cent and changes in the indirect tax system seem to explain about half of this increase. The paper also applies a recent method of measuring the distributional impact of relative price changes caused by changes in tax rates of commodities (Newbery, 1995) and establishes that indirect tax reforms introduced since 1988 had an adverse impact on the distribution of purchasing power, which nevertheless seems to be very small.</p>

For the analysis of the 1988 tax system, the 1988 HES has been used, while for the analysis of the 2002 tax
system, we have used the data from the most recent HES, conducted in 1999. This should provide a good

For all mean-independent inequality measures, such as the ones employed here, welfare distributions
corresponding to no indirect taxes or to uniform indirect taxes are equivalent, if one makes the additional
assumption that households will spend the same amount on commodities under prices corresponding to
different tax regimes and will only adjust the quantity bought (this corresponds to own-price elasticities of
demand equal to -1).</mixed-citation>
