         <abstract>
            <p>This paper argues that forward-looking indices of the effective tax burden on income from capital – namely, effective marginal and average tax rates – are negatively biased because traditional models overlook dividend constraints associated with financial tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation. The paper presents measures of the two indices adjusted to remove the bias and compares the new indices with the traditional ones. Numerical simulations carried out to quantify the magnitude of the bias for France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the UK give evidence of sizeable distortions in the unadjusted indices and, in turn, suggest significant mismeasurement in the current assessment of the effective tax burden.</p>

A permanent difference between the tax and accounting assessments occurs whenever an item of
revenue or cost is solely assessed for accounting or tax purposes. Examples include tax-free revenues
(gains benefiting from a special exemption regime) or expenditures expressly disallowed for tax purposes
(such as business entertainment) and expenses for items not entirely related to the business (such as
mobile phones and cars).</mixed-citation>

This framework is ultimately consistent with King (1974). As will be clarified later in this section, the
advantage of considering permanent shocks is that firms' investment and financial behaviour can be
directly inferred from the theory rather than being chosen arbitrarily. Nevertheless, any sort of departure
from this initial framework can be easily designed into the model.</mixed-citation>

Equation (1) is derived from the standard no-arbitrage condition which must hold in a perfect capital
market. The condition states that after-tax rates of return from alternative investment opportunities must
be equal in a ffictionless competitive market. See King (1974).</mixed-citation>

This formulation of 9 encompasses most systems of dividend taxation currently adopted in the EU.
Where a classical system of dividend taxation is followed, 6 can be measured under the restrictions of
either (i) a &gt; 0 and at = 1 or (ii) &lt;7 = 0, &lt;u = 0, tp J: 0 and tc = 0. The exemption system would imply either
(i) a = 0 and a&gt; = 1 under füll exemption or (ii) &lt;r = 0, 0 &lt; œ &lt;,tp j^O and tc = 0 under partial exemption.
The imputation system would require 6 to be computed under the restrictions r0, gj = 0, and tc ^
0.</mixed-citation>

The value of Wo is used as the denominator of EATR% because, when comparing the post-tax
convenience of alternative investment projects, firms only take into account projects earning at least the
