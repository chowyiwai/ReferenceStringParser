         <abstract>
            <p>Because of limited liability, insolvent banks have an incentive to continue lending to insolvent borrowers, in order to hide losses and gamble for resurrection, even though this is socially inefficient. We suggest a scheme that regulators could use to solve this problem. The scheme would induce banks to reveal their bad loans, which can then be dealt with. Bank participation in the scheme would be voluntary. Even though banks have private information on the quantity of bad loans on their balance sheets, the scheme avoids creating windfall gains for bank equity holders. In addition, some losses can be imposed on debt holders.</p>

Note that again, if the regulator implements the scheme in a way that allows observing the actual recoveries
when loans are foreclosed or modified immediately, this information could be used to make inferences about the
quality of the underlying collateral, which might be useful for estimating the recoveries that could have been
obtained if action on the bad loans had been delayed.</mixed-citation>

More generally, managers might hide information about the true profitability of projects from investors. In the
literature on managerial incentives, papers such as Levitt and Snyder (1997), Eisfeldt and Rampini (2008), and
Inderst and Mueller (2010) characterize the payment schemes that investors can use to elicit information about
the profitability of a project from a risk-averse manager.</mixed-citation>

As noted in the introduction, insolvent borrowers whose loans are rolled over (or not modified) are likely to have
incentives to extract value, whatever the cost to the bank. This is likely to destroy value overall, as could be
demonstrated via a model in which the borrower has to make an effort to maintain the value of collateral.</mixed-citation>

Could Coasian bargaining between private parties without the involvement of the regulator solve the gambling
problem by a reorganization of the capital structure (Haugen and Senbet 1978)? Here, the fact that equity holders
have private information can mean that such negotiations might not take place, as in Giammarino (1989). In
addition, it is reasonable to believe that banks would have incentives ex ante to choose debt structures that would
make such ex post bargaining impossible, as argued by Bolton and Scharfstein (1996). That is, even though in
the baseline model there are no externalities, it is plausible to assume that private parties would not solve the
gambling problem ex ante or ex post.</mixed-citation>

In the class of schemes with voluntary participation, the only general way of improving on the incentives
produced by our scheme would be to reward banks that end up having a low proportion of bad loans with
positive information rents. It can be shown that due to global incentive compatibility constraints, this necessarily
also implies paying positive (although smaller) information rents to all banks that have a larger proportion of
bad loans, reducing the appeal of such a mechanism. Under schemes with mandatory participation, incentives
could be improved without necessarily increasing cost, but the improvement would be limited by the necessary
convexity of participation profits.</mixed-citation>

As highlighted in Remark 1, for positive transfers F{6), participating banks foreclose all bad loans and hence
participation profits are determined by (16). Starting from this expression, the conditions can be derived in the
standard way [see, for example the description in Fudenberg and Tirole (1991), section 7.3].</mixed-citation>

This is a special case of the argument of Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare (1995), who point out that, in general,
decreasing convex outside opportunities can lead to optimal contracts that eliminate information rents for a
range of agents. Remarkably, in our model this property holds globally due to the convexity of the participation
value of equity in y.</mixed-citation>

A more complicated version of the welfare function would arise if B, the social cost of bank failure, were to
