         <abstract>
            <p>Liquid assets such as cash and marketable securities constitute a considerable portion of total assets, say 6.3% to 9.6%, of manufacturing firms. Financial managers pay a lot of attention to the measurement and management of corporate liquidity. It has also been recognized that a consequence of severe shortage of liquidity is financial distress. This study analyzes the relationship of the costs of financial distress to the level of corporate liquidity maintained and leverage. The financing contracts of a firm can be loosely categorized into hard and soft contracts. An example of a hard contract is a coupon debt contract which specifies periodic payments by the firm to the bondholders. If these payments are not made on time, the firm is considered to be in violation of the contract and the claimholders can seek specified and unspecified legal recourses to enforce the contract. The assets of a firm also have a natural categorization based on liquidity. Cash or cashlike (marketable) securities are liquid assets. Long-term investments (such as plant and machinery), which may only produce liquid assets in the future, may be called "illiquid" assets. The firm is in financial distress when the currently available liquid assets are severely inadequate to meet the current obligations of its hard financial contracts. Management may try to cope with financial distress by (i) selling assets, either current or fixed, or (ii) renegotiating with its creditors to arrange a deferred payment schedule. Debt restructuring may be done privately in a workout or formally in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The total costs of (i) and/or (ii) constitute costs of financial distress. Two testable implications are: (a) the proportion of total assets invested by a firm in liquid assets (e.g., cash and marketable securities) will be increasing in its costs of financial distress, and (b) the proportion of debt in the capital structure of a firm will be decreasing in its costs of financial distress. The most important cost of asset liquidation is the destruction of going-concern value that occurs when assets are sold to pay down debt. This loss of value will be greater for intangible assets and assets that generate firm-specific rents (e.g., growth opportunities, managerial firm-specific human capital, monopoly power, and operating synergies whose value depends on the firm's assets being kept together). Replacement cost approximates what the firm's assets could be sold for piecemeal, and is positively correlated with the liquidation value of the assets. Firms with a higher market value/replacement cost ratio will have a higher cost of asset liquidation. Therefore, Tobin's q ratio (equal to market value/replacement cost) will be used as a proxy for the loss of going-concern value in asset sales and premature liquidations associated with financial distress. The costs of liquidation are higher for firms that produce unique or specialized products. Their workers and suppliers often have job-specific skills and capital, and their customers find it difficult to find alternative servicing for their relatively unique products. For these reasons, a high degree of specificity or uniqueness engenders high distress costs. Expenditures on research and development over sales and advertising over sales are indicators of uniqueness. As a proxy for asset specificity, a dummy variable SPC is constructed, where SPC equals one for firms with SIC codes between 3400 and 4000 (firms producing machines and equipment) and zero otherwise. I estimate a linear relationship between corporate liquidity and proxies for the costs of financial distress. The liquidity ratio is positively related to these proxies (such as Tobin's q, R&amp;D and advertising expenditures, asset specificity, and the probability of bankruptcy). It is negatively related to proxies for alternate sources of anticipated liquidity such as intermediate cash flows, debt financing, length of cash cycle and the collateral value of assets. I estimate a linear relationship between debt (two measures: total debt and long-term debt) and proxies for costs of financial distress. Total debt is also negatively related to Tobin's q and asset specificity as well as measures of intermediate cash flows. Long-term debt is also negatively relatively to Tobin's q and asset specificity. Overall, the evidence is strongly consistent with the hypothesized positive relationship between corporate liquidity and financial distress costs, and the negative relationship between corporate leverage and financial distress costs. The conceptual framework and the empirical results can be used by financial managers and consultants to determine the liquidity and leverage policies of their firms. All the variables used in this study can be computed for the specific firm of interest from available data. Models in Equations (1) and (2) can be used normatively to guide the implementation of my framework for specific firms. In some cases, the models may be reestimated for a more appropriate subset of firms. The linear models I have used can also form the starting point for developing and estimating a more elaborate nonlinear specification, when appropriate.</p>
