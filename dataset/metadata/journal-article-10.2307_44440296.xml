            <p>THE present wartime rationing of gasoline has jolted those of us who drive cars into a realization that those cars, in most cases, are not being driven as efficiently as possible. Out of this realization has come the desire to get as many miles per gallon from our rationed fuel as we possibly can, even at the cost of lower power, slower acceleration, and not quite as smooth a running engine as we have been accustomed to in the past. One of the suggestions that has been made for getting more miles per gallon out of our present engines is to "split" the engine, using only one-half of the cylinders for power. This paper is a résumé of the results of a test program carried out by the Bendix Aviation Corp. to explore the possibilities of the split engine.</p>
