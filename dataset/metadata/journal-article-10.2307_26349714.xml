         <abstract>
            <p>A mother giving birth in December can claim child-related tax benefits when she files her tax return a few months later. Mothers of January-born children must wait more than a year before receiving child-related tax benefits. Thus, families with December births have higher after-tax income in the first year of a child's life than otherwise similar families with January births. This paper estimates the corresponding income effect on maternal labor supply. December mothers have a lower probability of working, particularly in the third month after a child's birth, and we find some evidence that child-related tax benefits reduce maternal earnings.</p>

We do not include the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), which reimburses parents for
some portion of out-of-pocket child care expenses paid in order to allow a parent to work. The reason
for excluding this from our calculation is that we do not observe child care expenses in any of our data-
sets. The total tax savings delivered to families through the CDCTC is only about one-tenth of the tax
savings associated with the dependent exemption, and about one-twentieth of the tax savings associated
with the EITC, so our inability to calculate this benefit likely has little effect on our results (Isaacs et al.,
2011).</mixed-citation>

This assumption is likely correct for the majority of our sample, as the percentage of all returns taking the
standard deduction ranged between 62.6 and 67.5 percent over the time period of our analysis (Statistics
of Income, 2015). To the extent that this assumption is incorrect, though, it will cause us to overstate the
value of child-related tax benefits. Presumably those who choose to itemize do so because it lowers their
tax liability, which in turn will reduce the value of nonrefundable tax credits, including the Child Tax
Credit.</mixed-citation>

There is evidence that December and January EITC-eligible parents report different amounts of self-
employment income on tax returns. LaLumia, Sallee, and Turner (2015) consider filers with incomes in
the EITC-eligible range and with self-employment income. Comparing those whose December newborns
qualify them for a more generous EITC schedule to those with January newborns and less generous EITC
treatment, the parents of December newborns report self-employment income that bunches around the
EITC-maximizing level. If this is strictly a tax reporting response, and does not reflect real changes in
labor supply, then the bunching pattern will not necessarily appear in income data drawn from surveys
instead of from tax returns.</mixed-citation>

This procedure will produce valid estimates as long as the differing tax treatment of December and January
mothers has no dynamic effect on maternal labor supply persisting into the second year of a child's life.

This is the full set of years that both overlaps with the ACS and SIPP data used in this paper and for which
publicly-available counts by exact date of birth are available. The NCVS has not published birth counts
by exact date of birth for years after 2003. In the set of six December-January pairs included in the figure,
there is no Saturday observation for December 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31 or January 7, 14, 21, and 28. There is
no Sunday observation for December 4,11, 18, and 25 or January 1,8,15,22, and 29. Daily birth counts
are consistently lower on weekends than on weekdays. As a result, we observe higher birth counts on dates
that are missing either a Saturday or Sunday over the period plotted in the figure.</mixed-citation>

It would be interesting to study additional graphical evidence related to the probability that a mother is
working three months after giving birth. In particular, we would like to produce a regression discontinuity
figure plotting the share of mothers at work three months after birth, by exact date of birth. The need to
protect the confidentiality of survey respondents prevents us from producing such a figure. When cells
are defined by a combination of exact date of birth and time elapsed between giving birth and the ACS
interview, the number of cell-specific observations is often below the Census Bureau threshold for report-
ing means.</mixed-citation>

Recall that in the SIPP we observe only month of birth, not exact date of birth, and thus we are comparing
mothers who give birth at any point in December to mothers who give birth at any point in January. This
difference in the set of births included in the SIPP and ACS analysis could complicate comparisons across
datasets. To probe this issue, we have estimated ACS results as if only month of birth was observable.
That is, we expand the ACS sample to include mothers giving birth at any point in December or January.
We again find that December mothers are significantly less likely to be currently employed and at work
in the third month after birth and in the eight month after birth. The coefficients on these two interaction
terms are -0.028 (standard error = 0.016) and -0.051 (standard error = 0.018).</mixed-citation>

Even though we have argued above that tax refunds are likely to have the greatest impact on short-term
labor supply decisions at the moment that they are received, taxpayers do not immediately spend the
entirety of any refunds received. For example, Souleles (1999) finds that recipients spend between 35 and
60 percent of tax refund payments within one quarter of receipt. The slower the rate at which refunds are
spent down, the more plausible it is that the differing tax treatment of December and January mothers will
affect labor supply several months after refunds are disbursed.</mixed-citation>

Tax treatment does differ again when children age out of eligibility for child-related benefits. For most
tax provisions, this occurs when the child turns age 18 or when a child who is a full-time student turns
age 24. Several authors have used variation in the time at which a child becomes ineligible for benefits to
estimate labor supply and other effects (Looney and Singhal, 2006; Dokko, 2008; Feldman, Kawano, and
KatuSiÃ©k, 2016).</mixed-citation>

It is worth noting that this falsification test will be invalid if the differing tax treatment of December and
January mothers during the first year of a child's life has dynamic or persistent effects on labor supply in
subsequent years. For example, it could be the case that if December mothers take more time away from
work in the first year of a child's life, their lower levels of recent work experience make them less attrac-
tive job candidates in subsequent years.</mixed-citation>

Better-educated workers tend to sort into larger firms (Evans and Leighton, 1989), and only firms with 50
or more employees are mandated by the FMLAto provide job-protected leave (Ruhm, 1997), It is worth
noting that this leave can begin before the birth of a child. Thus, greater scheduling flexibility may affect
the length of antenatal leave, which we cannot measure in ACS data, rather than the timing of the return
to work after giving birth.</mixed-citation>

In principle, we could use Î² measure of hours worked to consider the intensive margin of labor supply.
In practice, ACS respondents report the usual number of hours worked per week, averaging over the 12
months prior to the ACS interview. This makes the ACS hours worked variable a poor candidate for ana-
lyzing short-run changes in work intensity.</mixed-citation>
