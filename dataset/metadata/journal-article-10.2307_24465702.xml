         <abstract>
            <p>We investigate whether short-termism distorts the investment decisions of stock market-listed firms. To do so, we compare the investment behavior of observably similar public and private firms, using a new data source on private U.S. firms and assuming for identification that closely held private firms are subject to fewer short-termist pressures. Our results show that compared with private firms, public firms invest substantially less and are less responsive to changes in investment opportunities, especially in industries in which stock prices are most sensitive to earnings news. These findings are consistent with the notion that short-termist pressures distort investment decisions.</p>

Writing in the Harvard Business Review, Barton and Wiseman (2014), global managing director at McKinsey &amp;
Co. and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, respectively, argue that "the ongoing short-termism
in the business world is undermining corporate investment, holding back economic growth." The Kay Review of
U.K. Equity Markets and Long-Term Decision-Making, published in 2012, echoes this sentiment, while similar
points have been made in The Economist ("The profits prophet," October 5, 2013) and the Financial Times
("Corporate investment: A mysterious divergence," July 24, 2013).</mixed-citation>

Most studies of investment dynamics use firm-level data from Compustat and so focus on public firms. The
exceptions are studies that use plant-level data from the Census of Manufactures (Caballero et al. 1995; Cooper

Commercial users of the Sageworks database only have access to data aggregated by industry and region. This

The change in noncurrent assets captures investment in both fixed and intangible assets. Another form of
investment, R&amp;D, is usually expensed and so does not affect intangibles. We cannot model investment in R&amp;D
as Sageworks does not break out R&amp;D spending. We will report evidence showing it is highly unlikely that our
results are driven by this data limitation.</mixed-citation>

The purpose of matching is not to eliminate all observable differences between public and private firms but
to make firms comparable along the dimensions thought to affect the outcome variable of interest (here:
investment). Overmatching on dimensions unrelated to the outcome variable of interest results in samples that are
unrepresentative of their respective populations. In other words, we can make matched firms arbitrarily similar to
each other on arbitrarily many dimensions, but as we do so, the firms that end up in the matched sample become
ever less representative of their respective groups. See Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (1999) for an exhaustive
discussion of this point.</mixed-citation>

Contrast this with the fact that the average (median) public-firm CEO in our sample owns a mere 3.1% (0.66%)

Sageworks does not report R&amp;D data, so we cannot test for differences in R&amp;D spending. Moreover, Sageworks
firms are anonymous, so we cannot obtain information about their patenting activity. However, Bernstein's
(Forthcoming) results suggest that including innovation is unlikely to close the investment gap between public
and private firms: he finds that going public leaves a firm's scale of innovation unchanged (as measured by the
number of patents), while reducing the novelty of its innovations (as measured by patent citations).</mixed-citation>

To match on other variables besides industry and size, we construct a propensity score based on size and additional
matching variables. We then adapt the matching algorithm described in Section 2.2 as follows: for each public
firm, we find the private firm with the closest propensity score that operates in the same four-digit NAICS
industry, imposing a 0.05 caliper.</mixed-citation>

The variable Z/A is ROA. Prior work shows that standard proxies for investment opportunities are not,
as neoclassical theory predicts, a sufficient statistic for investment and that ROA correlates positively with
investment. The latter is often interpreted as a sign of financing constraints (Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen
1988), though some disagree (Kaplan, and Zingales 1997). While we are agnostic about the debate surrounding
its interpretation, we follow the literature by conditioning on ROA.</mixed-citation>

This test limits private firms to C Corps, as other legal forms are not subject to corporate taxes in most states.
The Internet Appendix exploits this fact as an indirect validity test of our tax identification strategy. If corporate
tax changes capture changes in firms' investment opportunities rather than, say, reflecting changes in a state's
economic environment, they should have no effect on the investment behavior of non-C Corps. This is precisely
what we find; see Column 4 in Table IA. 1.</mixed-citation>

The manager may care about the current stock price because he intends to sell some of his stockholdings (as
suggested by Stein 1989 and confirmed empirically by Bhojraj et al. 2009) or because he fears losing his job in the
event of a hostile takeover (Shleifer and Vishny 1990; Stein 1988). Another possibility is that some shareholders
may incentivize the manager to pursue short-termist actions that increase the firm's stock price in the short term
(albeit at the expense of long-run fundamental value) in the hope of selling the stock in the future to potentially
overoptimistic investors (see Bolton, Scheinkman, and Xiong 2006 for such a model).</mixed-citation>

While CAPEX is not expensed, it does depress earnings by increasing depreciation. Graham, Harvey, and
Rajgopal (2005) report survey evidence that managers avoid missing earnings-per-share (EPS) targets by cutting
CAPEX to reduce "depreciation charges to earnings." Almeida, Fos, and Kronlund (2013) emphasize that, in
addition to increasing the numerator in EPS by reducing depreciation, cutting CAPEX frees up cash for share
repurchases, which can reduce the denominator in EPS.</mixed-citation>

Following our approach, Gilje and Taillard (2013) show that natural gas producers have a below-median ERC,
which in turn could explain why the public firms in their sample appear not to invest myopically.</mixed-citation>

Another agency problem that might distort the investment decisions of public firms is empire building. However,
if this were a prevalent distortion among public firms, they would invest more than private ones, the opposite of
what we find in Tables 2 and 3. An alternative hypothesis that might a priori explain why public and private firms
invest differently is the possibility that private firms are financially constrained. However, recall from Section
3.2.2 that we found no support for the notion that private firms'-higher investment and investment sensitivity
are the result of financial constraints. Other channels that may explain the observed differences in investment
behavior between public and private firms include the idea that public firms are weighed down by rules and
regulations designed to protect minority shareholders or that private firms are capital inefficient or inexperienced
at making investment decisions. None of these alternative channels seems to predict our Table 7 findings.</mixed-citation>
