         <abstract>
            <p>The Nigerian Government had over the years accepted housing, at least in principle, as a social responsibility hence high priority declaration statements. In spite of such declarations, enormous gap still exists between housing requirements and the financial resources required for its provision. Presently, the financial institutions involved in housing finance in Nigeria are the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN), commercial banks, merchant banks, and insurance companies. Their ability to meet the financial needs of the housing sector is bedevilled by inadequate funds (particularly long-term capital); loan defaults and recovery problems; absence of secondary mortgage market and guarantees; mass poverty; their inefficiency in resource mobilization; rising population, urbanization, high cost of building materials and inflation, and ineffective targetting of government subsidies. Given the existence of scope for changes in the housing finance system, the paper recommends as follows: the development of a secondary mortgage market and a mortgage insurance scheme; effecting the apex role of the FMBN; involvement of the Nigerian Provident Fund in housing finance; purchase of sites and services loans; increased resource mobilization through mandatory and contractual savings schemes; modification of Central Bank credit guidelines and legal provision formulation of effective loan recovery strategy, and housing cost reduction and the use of local raw materials. The role of the Government in these areas and particularly in providing housing for the low-income earners can hardly be overemphasized.</p>
