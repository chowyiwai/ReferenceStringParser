Bingley et al. (1993) estimate a random utility discrete choice model of labour supply for UK lone mothers
which is a more complex model than the one used here. See Hausman (1980) and Moffitt (1986a) for US
models of participation and hours of work. Fraker and Moffitt (1988), in particular, estimate a model of part-
time and full-time labour force participation, Food Stamp and AFDC participation. There has been no
equivalent UK work that addresses both labour supply and the take-up of means-tested benefits (see Blundell

An alternative method is to instrument the (net marginal) wage. However, because there are no obvious

Age, time and regional dummies are included for a number of reasons: the differences in the composition
of the type of lone mother over time and cohorts and across regions, differences in the fixed costs of work, etc.
There has been a noticeable increase in the provision of child care facilities over this period, a marked
deterioration in unemployment over the first half of this period, and quite marked changes in the composition
of lone parents, all of which may be expected to play a role but may be only imperfectly captured by the
included variables. Similarly job market and child care opportunities may differ systematically across regions,
but the local level of unemployment may not adequately capture the former. Finally, age dummies are included
for both cohort and life-cycle reasons and to capture the time series changes that have occurred in the
composition of lone mothers: for example, there has been a quite marked reduction in the proportion of
widowed and a marked increase in the proportion of never married lone mothers over the period considered
here.</mixed-citation>

However, there is no guarantee that the new formula-driven levels of CS would exceed the actual present

In order to assess the labour market impact we need to be able to compute the level of CS under the reform
as well as know the existing level. This poses a considerable problem since the proposed CS formula is driven
partly by the earnings of the both the caring parent and the absent parent. In the absence of specific information
about the earnings of absent parents in FES data we have estimated an earnings equation for a sample of
married men with children and a spouse present in the household where the explanatory variables are the
characteristics of the wife. This equation is used to predict the incomes of absent parents - the presumption
being that separation is exogenous so that the equation produces unbiased predictions of the earnings of absent
parents. These predictions allow us to compute the maintenance bill if we make a further assumption about
the housing costs, and new domestic circumstances of the absent parent. The main drawback of this procedure
is that it assumes that absent fathers have the same earnings as employed married men. It seems likely that men
who are "unsuccessful" in marriage are likely to be less successful than average in the labour market - although
it is possible to think of arguments that go in the other direction. Moreover, they may be more likely to be
unemployed than married men with spouse present. We ignore both these sources of error which would lead
us to predict lower government expenditure than would otherwise be the case.</mixed-citation>

Moreover, we interpret the CS dummies in the model as indicating that this source of income is uncertain,
and in our reform simulation we assume that the reform has the effect of eliminating this uncertainty.</mixed-citation>
