This construction of profiles to provide benchmarks for comparison and extrapolation under differing
assumptions is a variant of the method made famous by Weber with the name 'ideal type' analysis.
Imaginary but not unrealistic examples are described in detail to gain a hold on the enormous range of
possibilities in the real world. These calculations will not apply to the whole labour force. The female
earnings profiles are identical to the central example generated and explained in Joshi (1989) with the
exception that employment is assumed to remain full-time until retirement whether or not the woman has
children.</mixed-citation>

For the sake of simplicity we have ignored the de-linking of the Upper and Lower Earnings Limit from
earnings growth which has occurred since 1979. This has important implications for the value of future
benefits that we leave outside the scope of this paper. For example a growing proportion of part-timers
will come into contributions by the falling relative level of the LEL.</mixed-citation>

Note that we are only calculating the return on contributions paid by the employee, whereas in fact
employers also pay a contribution at least as large. Many economists calculate an employee's
remuneration by adding on the value of this contribution. Including the employer's contribution would
lower the ration to approximately half that estimated in Table 3. Another complication which has not
been taken into account is that the widow's pension is set against her own contributions, though those of
her deceased spouse might more logically be though of as having produced that pension. Another
objection to calculating a 'return' on contributions paid in this way is that NI pensions operate on a Pay
as You Go basis.</mixed-citation>

Research on the pre-1987 rules (Hemming (1984), Hemming and Kay (1982), Ermisch (1981))
demonstrated the mature scheme to be very expensive in terms of the contribution rates required of future
generations of workers — Hemming (1984) estimated 20.5 per cent even in a world with no demographic
change, which compares with the 14.5 per cent currently required to finance retirement pensions. These
kinds of figures were in part responsible for the 1986 reforms, which are projected to halve the cost of
SERPS (DHSS (1985)), so perhaps we are now talking in terms of a contribution rate of 20 per cent in a
steady state. In practice the rate will be higher becuase of adverse demographic movements in the next
century (Ermisch (1981), Hemming (1984)).</mixed-citation>

Married women were not treated equally as they were assumed to be supported by their husbands.
Indeed this helps to explain why the current generation of elderly women are as financially vulnerable as
we saw earlier in the paper.</mixed-citation>
