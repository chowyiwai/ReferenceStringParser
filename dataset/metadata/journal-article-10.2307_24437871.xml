The Gini coefficient is an inequality measure based on income shares which can take a value of between 1 and
0, where 1 indicates that inequality is at its greatest and 0 means that everyone receives the same income. A formula
is provided in, for example, Morris and Preston (1986).</mixed-citation>

Half the squared coefficient of variation is defined as cr2/^2 where a is the standard deviation of the distribution
and ft is the mean of the distribution. Although useful for our purposes, it is a measure of inequality that is rather
sensitive to extreme outliers in the data. As a result, we reset some outliers from our data such that, in each year,
pensioners with recorded incomes below 25 per cent of the average had their income reset to one-quarter of the
mean. A similar adjustment was made for those with income above six times the mean. Out of a total of 61,011
observations, 295 were affected. While this is not an ideal procedure, it was felt necessary if genuine trends were
to be distinguished from noisy data. The methodology resulted in slight movements in the ranking of the distribution
between years, but of other possible procedures evaluated, it was clearly the most satisfactory.</mixed-citation>

Despite the fact that the Gini coefficient is a measure giving greatest weight to changes near the middle of the
distribution while half the squared coefficient of variation is sensitive to outliers, we found little difference in the
inequality ranking among different years using the two measures. The most and least equal years were the same
on both measures. More than three-quarters of the years had the same ranking in terms of income inequality, or
differed by just one place.</mixed-citation>

We also tried splitting the pensioner population by age-group but found little of interest either by way of different
inequality within age-groups or by way of different trends among the different age-groups.</mixed-citation>
