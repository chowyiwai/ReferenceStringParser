         <abstract>
            <p>Of the many devices for eliciting employee commitment to organizational goals, few have greater potential or have commanded more attention than employee ownership. Owning part of the organization provides many of the essentials of commitment and motivation, especially if ownership form enhances owner goal achievement. Unfortunately, employee ownership also contains the ingredients of entrapment into a hopeless venture. The task of the manager and community official is to find a match between type and degree of ownership and owner objectives that will garner strong organization commitment while providing the feedback and analysis necessary to avoid entrapment. A model is developed to guide the evaluation process.</p>
