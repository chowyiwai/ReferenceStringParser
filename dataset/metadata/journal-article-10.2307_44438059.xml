         <abstract>
            <p>AIRCRAFT have taken more from automobile design than they have given, but they can now repay much of the obligation without necessarily transgressing the requirements of production economy and reasonable design stability. Some of these possibilities are: (1) Improved streamlining of necessary exposed parts, particularly underneath, and incorporation of other accessories in the general body lines. (2) Use of curved glass in the windshield and lightening of all window material. (3) Reduction of the frame to the status of an assembly unit, with structural significance only in combination with the body. (4) More effective distribution of flange material around the doors. (5) Lightening of skin by use of internal stiffeners, particularly on top. (6) Development of a smaller, more efficient radiator and lightening of various engine parts. Most important is the mental attitude behind the work. Phenomenal production economy has been attained because almost every man in the industry has concentrated on it. Worthwhile weight and drag reduction would result if even one competent man were assigned specifically to that duty. Lightening, with streamlining, is a beneficent cycle that permits still further lightening, resulting directly in substantial operating economies and, indirectly, in lower production cost.</p>
