            <p>STATING that variation in knock-testing results with a relatively high oil-consumption is partly due to the oil itself, the series of tests conducted at the laboratory of the Standard Oil Development Co. is described. This is supplemented by tables giving the average results obtained in several tests in which the operating conditions were very carefully controlled. Conclusions drawn by the author are that the error due to different rates of oil consumption and variation of oil temperature may be as great as one octane number and is not affected by the kind of oil used. Recommendations that the oil consumption be kept at the minimum for safety and good operation and that the oil temperature be kept constant at as low a value as is consistent with good lubrication are made.</p>
