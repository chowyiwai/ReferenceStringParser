         <p>Today we are witnessing an increased use of data visualization in society. Across domains such as work, education and the news, various forms of graphs, charts and maps are used to explain, convince and tell stories. In an era in which more and more data are produced and circulated digitally, and digital tools make visualization production increasingly accessible, it is important to study the conditions under which such visual texts are generated, disseminated and thought to be of societal benefit. This book is a contribution to the multi-disciplined and multi-faceted conversation concerning the forms, uses and roles of data visualization in society. Do data visualizations do 'good' or 'bad'? Do they promote understanding and engagement, or do they do ideological work, privileging certain views of the world over others? The contributions in the book engage with these core questions from a range of disciplinary perspectives.</p>

                     <p>Geographer John Pickles once wrote that ‘GIS is a set of tools, technologies, approaches and ideas that are vitally embedded in broader transformations of science, society, and culture’.

                     <p>I often joke—although I’m inclined to believe—that a field X reaches maturity when a parallel field of ‘philosophy of X’ springs into existence. That hasn’t happened yet with data visualization, at least formally. Might we be on the path to it, though? I hope so. Some books have</p>

                     <p>Today we are witnessing an increased use of data visualization in a range of domains and genres. In journalism, education, and public information as well as in workplaces, diverse forms of graphs, charts, and maps are used to explain, persuade, and tell stories. At best, visual representations of statistics and other, often quantitative data can convey complex facts and patterns quickly and effectively. At worst, they can appear confusing or manipulative. In an era in which more and more data are produced and circulated through online networks, and digital tools make visualization production increasingly accessible, it is important to study</p>

                     <p>Data visualizations combine at least two modes of representation: numerical data and visual diagrams. For a computer program to be able to process data, it has to be converted to numbers, to the zeros and ones of machine code. In addition, the data need to be visually organized, which often requires dividing them into discrete quantities where lines, size, spatial placement, and other visual elements show certain patterns in the data. Each of these two modes of expression, the numeric and the visual, carries its own affordances and constraints for what they can express.</p>

                     <p>This chapter is a focused critical overview of social semiotics as a productive framework for research on data visualization. It aims to provide conceptual instruments that can be used to explore the relationship between the formal properties of data visualization and the kinds of responses, engagements, and practices that these may promote or hinder among users. Over the last decade or so, and in the wake of digitalization and datafication, data visualization has emerged rapidly as what Engebretsen and Weber (2017) have defined as a ‘super-genre’ that is used to accomplish a wide variety of communicative tasks across an increasing</p>

                     <p>Data and their visualizations are becoming increasingly important in a variety of domains of Western societies (van Dijck, 2014; Couldry &amp; Hepp, 2016). Kennedy, Hill, Aiello, and Allen (2016, p. 715) comment that ‘[…] data are becoming increasingly valued and relied upon, as they come to play an ever more important role in decision-making and knowledge about the world’. Through their encoding, circulation, and uptake in private, public as well as institutional contexts, data visualizations operate in real-world contexts where politics and power are at work. As such, they have potential significance as instruments or sites for change.</p>

                     <p>In late August of 2017, the spokesperson for a Dutch association of campsite owners criticized <italic>Buienradar</italic>, an often-used weather forecast website and app, for the financial setbacks its members had incurred over the course of the summer. In an interview with a local newspaper, he posited a causal relation between patrons’ use of the service and cancellations received in the week prior to their stay (Baard &amp; Hellegers, 2017). The news report suggests that he primarily blamed the weather service itself, as a source of misleading information. But his statements also betray frustration with the customers, for blindly trusting the</p>

                     <p>The abundance of social media data and the development of computational methods have led to the birth of new business opportunities, including the growing field of data analytics.

David Beer (2017) describes data analytics companies as new powerful <italic>data intermediaries</italic> who build infrastructure to shape the circulation of social data and construct narratives of omnipotent and intelligent calculative technologies to reach objective, correct solutions and decisions in organizations.

                     <p>Data visualization plays an important role in the information environment, communicating complex messages through simplified yet powerful representations of otherwise opaque data. Data visualization is deployed in different contexts and in various settings, such as the representation of business information within or between companies, the delivery of products and services to personal consumers, and the communication of news and information in the public sphere. Within this broad landscape, data visualization is deployed to achieve different aims and objectives and can be tailored to do so for specific audiences. In a business setting, for example, the audience may be trained to</p>

This introduction is the prelude to Latour’s call to study the production of knowledge ‘in the making’, instead of merely focusing on outcomes (1987, p. 4). In this chapter, we respond to Latour’s call to bring the epistemic process, and particularly, the ways in which data are imag(in) ed, to the foreground of the research communication. Our approach ‘stages’ the ‘cultural life’ of a</p>

This ability may be seen as a kind of literacy, which requires certain skills that may be related to the meaning-making resources applied, to the digital technology, and to the understanding of specialized conventions in statistics. This article will explore this concept of literacy theoretically and discuss it in light of empirical examples. The examples were observed in Social Science classrooms in upper secondary schools in Norway. The students were asked to use digital data visualizations to answer specific questions and</p>

                     <p>There is a growing body of literature arguing that working with data is a key modern skill (Letouzé et al., 2015; Wolff et al., 2016). And yet, while highly valued as a precursor to evidence-driven insight, data are expensive—to collect, maintain, and mobilize. Corporations, governments, and elite universities are the primary institutions which have the resources to undertake this work. Within those institutions, white men remain overrepresented in data-related fields such as computer science, engineering, and artificial intelligence, even as other STEM fields like biology have managed to narrow their gender gap (Corbett &amp; Hill, 2015; Neuhauser, 2015; West,</p>

                     <p>In this digital age, information and data are presented to us more and more often, on a range of subject matter, from many sources, across a variety of different channels, in different formats, relating to most aspects of our lives. This presents us with many things of which we need to make sense. Correspondingly, you do not have to look far to find a project or initiative offering to teach us how to make sense of some aspect of our digital, datafied worlds. Often these projects’ descriptions include the term literacy, and examples can be found across academia, practice, and</p>

                     <p>In an age in which more and more data are produced and circulated visually and digital environments make the production of data visualizations increasingly accessible, it is important to develop critical tools for people to engage with these kinds of texts. Data can be represented through a range of modes (such as writing, visuals, and numbers) and different data visualizations (from tables to graphs). There are design choices to be made in the production of these texts in terms of size, shape, colour, and composition in order to represent a particular argument to a particular audience in the most apt</p>

                     <p>Beauty is to be found everywhere, including the field of data visualization. Stunning in the various ways designers use colours, forms, and lines to turn data into imagery and graphical information, data visualizations can attract attention to their aesthetically pleasing expressions. But is it this kind of aesthetic endeavour that is appreciated or discussed in books, articles, and talks which address beautiful data visualizations? When authors like Julie Steele and Noah Lillinsky, or Edward Tufte, choose titles like <italic>Beautiful</italic> 
                        <italic>Visualizations</italic> and <italic>Beautiful Evidence</italic> for their books, what, exactly, does that imply? And, when David McCandless initiates the <italic>Information is Beautiful</italic>

                     <p>The current interest in multimodality, or how multiple modes of communication cooperate and interact, has opened up new opportunities for theoretical reflection and practical application within several fields. Thus we find in linguistics increasingly widespread statements that language should be seen as just one form of communication among many other, equally important expressive resources; visual communication begins to consider aspects of language; art history takes in the moving image; humancomputer interaction design is extended to include tactile and gestural communication rather than just language, and so on.

                     <p>Storytelling is deeply rooted in our society. From the very beginning of time people have told stories to convey ideas and thoughts, to share experience and knowledge, to express desires and feelings, or to remember the past. They have told stories with the purpose of informing and recording, explaining and persuading, understanding and entertaining. To this day, telling stories is a pivotal activity of our everyday lives. Stories help us to make sense of the world, to create individual and cultural identity, and to evoke emotions. Because of its emotional impact and cognitive effectiveness, storytelling has become an integral part</p>

                     <p>In recent years data visualization scholars and practitioners have drawn attention to the need for data to be humanized (D’Ignazio &amp; Klein, 2016; Gray, Bounegru, Milan, &amp; Ciuccarelli, 2016; Kennedy, Hill, Aiello, &amp; Allen, 2016; Lupton, 2017). Looking at possibilities for haptic and visceral data manifestations, Lupton (2017, p. 15) has called for the ‘generation of alternative or counter perspectives and greater opportunities for people to “feel” their data in ways which make sense in the context of their own lives’. In a piece that circulated around social media, data visualizer Giorgia Lupi provocatively asked, ‘Can a data visualization evoke</p>

                     <p>The vocabulary of diversity, pluralism, multiculturalism, and the proverbial ‘melting pot’ are often invoked in contemporary discourse to characterize the complex, highly fraught, and extraordinarily multilayered history of immigration, race, and cultural identity in the United States. Ideas about American identity—who people truly ‘are’ at some essential level, where they come from, how they choose to be identified, and how majority cultures may identify them—continue to evolve over time. Through this discursive space, groups work to access forms of cultural and political recognition and resources, all the while potentially excluding and/or including others as the boundaries of identity</p>

                     <p>What is data visualization for? Data visualizations in the media are not just about giving people easy or pretty access to information. They are about telling stories and they therefore work within the narrative frames of their designers and disseminators. When influential data visualizers write that data visualization can ‘change the world’ (Kosara, Cohen, Cukier, &amp; Wattenberg, 2009), implicitly <italic>for the better</italic>, we therefore need to ask questions of what they mean. If data visualization can change the world, then there is much at stake in the form. The assumption is that access to more data can enable us to</p>

                     <p>Cartography is defined as the art, science, and technology of making and using maps. It requires both qualitative and quantitative methodologies associated with data handling and information communication design. Maps are often seen as authoritative representations of truth (Pickles, 1995; Wood, 1992). There are interrelated processes, interactions, and negotiations during the design and the data collection phases of map-making (Pavlovskaya, 2018). When designed effectively, maps and diagrams can tell stories, offer interactive, dynamic insights into geographical patterns at multiple scales, and show trends over various temporal scales. A map should help the user to quickly grasp a concept or an</p>

                     <p>This contribution investigates the societal response to a pressing environmental risk to public health, the Southeast Asian haze, manifested through data visualization practices. A socio-legal analysis is conducted to understand the implications of haze counter-mapping by non-state actors along three lines: firstly, with regard to the filling of informational gaps in haze mapping, making <italic>visible</italic> ‘politically masked’ risks; secondly, as a source of social accountability and a trigger for personal and social agency; and thirdly, as a catalyst for legal accountability.</p>

                     <p>In <italic>Poststructuralist Geographies</italic>, Doel (1999) challenged readers to envisage a cartography that shimmers and think about ways in which flows, relations, and change can be mapped. Two decades ago, imagining a sparkling map entailed a leap of imagination; today, maps can glitter thanks to the geoweb—combining geographic, geospatial, and geotag overlay systems (Scharl &amp; Tochtermann, 2007)—and other technologies. The 15M map included in this study is an example. The 15M or indignad@s movement was a citizen uprising formed in the wake of a sit-down protest on May 15, 2011 in Madrid to demand a more representative democracy. Figure</p>
