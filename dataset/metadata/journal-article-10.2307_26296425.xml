                  <p>Brian McCue is a graduate of Hamilton College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has worked as a defense analyst for 31 years, first in private industry; then in the Department of Defense, where he wrote U-Boats in the Bay of Biscay as a Senior Fellow at the National Defense University; then at the United States Congress’s Office of Technology Assessment; and now-since 1996-at the Center for Naval Analyses.</p> 
                  <p>Though his work has taken many forms, Dr. McCue says that what he likes best is “to match real-world data to quantitative formulations that make sense in terms of physical reality.”</p>
