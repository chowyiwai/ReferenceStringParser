         <abstract>
            <p>THE 1940 CFR Road Tests have developed new information that can be used for the development of fuels and engines. Application of the principles worked out in these tests is expected to result in a more efficient utilization of fuel antiknock properties and more effective engine design and adjustment to meet the requisites of current motor fuels. These tests indicate that the ASTM octane number alone, or even a road octane number as determined by methods heretofore widely used, does not give sufficient information for present needs relative to fuel behavior in service. Neither do test methods previously used provide sufficient information concerning the fuel requirements and knocking characteristics of engines. The new methods of approach which have been developed furnish needed information relative to the fuel and engine relationship that heretofore has been obscure, and indicate paths for future developments. The entire program has been supported generously by the cooperating organizations and their respective representatives who actively participated in the tests. Various phases of the work have extended over most of the past year and, in the concluding and most important stage-the centralized road tests at San Bernardino, Calif. – 32 organizations were represented. In these concluding tests, a study was made of the characteristics of 23 fuels representing a wide variety of fuel types and the complimentary behavior of 24 different automobiles. During this latter period alone, the 24 test cars were driven over 100,000 miles.</p>
