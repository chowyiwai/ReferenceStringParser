            <p>Shocks to equity options' implied volatility are followed by persistently lower short-term rates. Shocks to puts' over calls' out-of-the-money implied volatilities (P/C) are followed by persistently higher rates. Stock and Treasury bond implied volatilities, which measure market and policy uncertainty, are countercyclical, while P/C, which measures downside risk, is procyclical. An equilibrium model in which investors and the central bank learn about composite regimes of economic and policy variables explains these dynamics, linking them to a learning-based, forward-looking Taylor rule. Survey data support our model's predictions on the effect of uncertainty on the level and fluctuations of implied volatilities.</p>

For example, Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) report that monetary policy surprises affect the stock market, while
Rigobon and Sack (2003) show that the monetary policy responds to stock returns with a greater reaction during
times of higher volatility. More recently Bekaert, Hoerova, and Duca (2010) find a significant reaction of options
prices to lead and lag measures of monetary policy.</mixed-citation>

In our empirical analysis, we use the three-month Treasury bill rate as our short-term rate, rather than the federal
funds rate, as the latter is affected by banks' default premium, which is absent in our model. The three-month
Treasury bill rate and the federal funds rate are very highly correlated.</mixed-citation>

Interestingly, we find that the put-to-call ratio P/C strongly predicts future interest rates, while we do not find
such relation with other measures of crash risk, such as the difference in implied volatility of out-of-the-money
puts versus at-the-money puts. Our fitted model is also consistent with this evidence. Panel F of Figure 1 shows
that shocks to the bond ATMIV also do not predict future interest rates, which is not inconsistent with our model
either, as we will show.</mixed-citation>

The new Keynesian economics approach shows the optimality of such rules in settings where price stickiness
implies deviations from short-run full employment and capacity utilization (see, e.g., Woodford 2003). Gallmeyer,
Hollifield, and Zin (2005), Gallmeyer et al. (2007), and Bekaert, Cho, and Moreno (2010) build term-structure
models using policy variables.</mixed-citation>

Lucas (2007) complains about the lack of use of monetary aggregates in recent models of monetary policy and
recommends their use in information extraction:
One source of this concern is the increasing reliance of central bank research on New-Keynesian
modeling. New-Keynesian models define monetary policy in terms of a choice of money market
rate and so make direct contact with central banking practice. Money supply measures play no
role in their estimation, testing or policy simulation. Arole for money in the long run is sometimes
verbally acknowledged, but the models themselves are formulated in terms of deviation from
trends that are themselves somewhere off stage. It seems likely that these models could be
reformulated to give a unified account of trends, including trends in monetary aggregates, and
deviations about trend but so far they have not been. This remains an unresolved issue on the
frontier of monetary theory. Until it is resolved, monetary information should continue to be
used as a kind of add-on or cross-check, just as it is in the ECB policy formulation today.</mixed-citation>

Coenen, Levin, and Wieland (2005) and Beck and Wieland (2008) show that money growth can help predict
real activity when the real output and real money are economically linked but the central bank, which partially
controls money growth, receives noisy information on the former.</mixed-citation>

For example, Guidolin and Timmermann (2005) and Buraschi and Jiltsov (2006) study option prices and volume
in models with learning about fundamentals. Dubinsky and Johannes (2006) study the reaction of options prices
on individual stocks to news about earnings. Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2011) show that the
increase in investors' perception about the average jump size of stock prices led to a steepening of the implied
volatility smirk after the stock market crash of 1987, but do not study its time variation in subsequent years.
In a paper related to ours, Shaliastovich (2009) models investors' non-Bayesian (behavioral) learning about the
long-run drift of consumption to generate the smile, but does not study its time-series fit to data series.</mixed-citation>

There is also a large literature that explains the volatility smile by assuming exogenous processes for stock
prices, volatilities, and jumps. Indeed, since the classic work of Black and Scholes (1973) the major innovations
have been the addition of stochastic volatility (see, e.g., Hull and White 1987 and Heston 1993), jumps in prices
(see, e.g., Bates 1996, 2000, Pan 2002), and jumps in volatility (see, e.g., Eraker, Johannes, and Poison 2003).
A tremendous amount of empirical work has been done on these extensions of the Black Scholes formula that
has enriched our understanding of stock price dynamics, and of options returns. Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997)
provide a specification analysis of some of these models. Among more recent innovations, Christoffersen et al.
(2008) build multifactor stochastic volatility models, and somewhat related to our paper, Johannes, Poison, and
Stroud (2009) price options when exogenously specified volatility follows an unobserved process that investors
learn about. Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2009) find that several exogenously specified volatility
models, such as GARCH, can be rejected as possible data-generating processes for S&amp;P 500 index options.</mixed-citation>

The first application of the Wonham filter in financial economics, as well as several properties of the filtering
process, are derived in David (1997). We find it useful to recall that a main advantage of this modeling strategy
as opposed to the more commonly used Kaiman filter is that investors' uncertainty (conditional variance of
expectations about the drift terms) fluctuates forever, while in the Kaiman filter, this uncertainty converges to
a constant. The fluctuating confidence (inverse of the conditional variance) is the driver of the options' indices
that we seek to explain in this paper.</mixed-citation>

While the relations between options and monetary policy described in this example are intuitive, we should
remember they depend on the three regimes used. As shown in Section 2, in reality there are many additional
composite macroeconomic-policy regimes, such as stagflation regimes, whose implications for the relation
between monetary policy and options may differ from what discussed in the simple example.</mixed-citation>

The first six regimes are similar to those in David and Veronesi (2013), who only fit inflation and real earnings,
but no monetary policy variables. Indeed, note that the last two regimes (7 and 8) are identical to Regime 1 and 2
for inflation and earnings, but differ in their monetary policy regime. Compared with David and Veronesi (2013),
the two additional fundamental series to fit (CU and MG) required an expansion of the number of composite
regimes from six to eight. See discussion in previous section.</mixed-citation>

We log linearize the model's growth rate of the moving average. In particular the first order approximation of
the growth rate is
log ~ -(w+z+y+x).
For the subset of the earnings data, where we have the quarterly growth rates available, the approximation leads
to a growth rate very close to the growth rate of the moving average.</mixed-citation>
