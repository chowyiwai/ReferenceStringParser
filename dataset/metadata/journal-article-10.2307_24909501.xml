            <p>The end-of-year formula is calculated on the implicit assumption that the costs and benefits occur in lump sums at year-end. When costs and benefits occur in a steady stream, applying mid-year discount factors is more appropriate. The first cost year is estimated to occur after six months, rather than at the end of one year to approximate better a steady stream of costs and benefits occurring in the first year.</p>
