         <abstract>
            <p>The paper aims to clarify the tax status of pension schemes in the UK and, by using economic and other arguments, to establish a theoretical benchmark that could be considered the 'appropriate' tax regime for pension saving. We consider existing tax regimes for saving (such as the 'ISA' regime) and theoretical regimes (such as a pure expenditure tax and a comprehensive income tax) and we compare the costs different tax regimes impose on defined contribution pension schemes. We conclude that an expenditure tax is an appropriate benchmark tax regime for pension saving, and that other tax regimes impose additional financial as well as administrative costs.</p>

For the purpose of the present paper, it is assumed that the nominal corporation tax rate is also the effective

This argument is not always clearly understood. It is often suggested that EET does tax returns from capital
because tax is ultimately paid on all the benefits received. However, the equivalence of EET with TEE (shown
by Meade (1978)) demonstrates that tax is not being paid on returns to capital. It is clear that returns to capital
are not taxed by TEE because no tax is paid on interest at any stage. If TEE and EET are equivalent, tax cannot
be paid on returns to capital in the EET case either. In EET, it is true that tax is paid on the total accumulated
fund, when it is paid out as a benefit. However, the tax is also deferred on the whole of the fund. The two
effects cancel out leaving the equivalent, in present-value terms, of a tax just on returns to labour. The
equivalence arguments are discussed in detail, for a single-period investment, in Meade (1978). The
generalisation to a multi-period model is trivial.</mixed-citation>

As all money that is not consumed must be bequeathed at death, the total tax paid in a lifetime and at death
would be the same if the system were TEE but with an inheritance tax at rate T as it would be under TTE.
However, the present value of tax paid would still be less under TEE (plus inheritance tax).</mixed-citation>

Some of the ratios are numerically very close across different investment funds for similar tax regimes. In
some cases, the high-equity investment policy gives a lower replacement ratio than the mid-equity investment
policy. This arises from our investment return assumptions, based on market values at the time, and the
particularly harsh tax treatment of UK equities in pension funds relative to other types of investment. Indeed, it
is notable, given our return assumptions, that the tax regime is much more important for explaining variability
in the replacement ratio than the asset allocation.</mixed-citation>
