         <abstract>
            <p>We document frictions in money market mutual fund lending that lead to the transmission of distress across borrowers. Using novel security-level holdings data, we show that funds exposed to Eurozone banks suffered large outflows in mid-2011. These outflows had significant spillovers: non-European issuers relying on such funds raised less short-term debt financing. Issuer characteristics do not explain the results: holding fixed the issuer, funds with higher Eurozone exposure cut lending more. Due to credit market frictions, funds with low Eurozone exposure provided substitute financing only to issuers they had pre-existing relationships with, even though issuers are large, highly rated firms.</p>

Despite the fact that only a relatively small number of issuers raise financing from MMMFs, there is anecdotal
evidence that the approved issuer lists are both restrictive and slow to change. For instance, Reich and Tang publish
their list on their Web site. On their November 15, 2011 list, the oldest that we have access to, there are over 150
issuers that are in our N-MFP data but are not preapproved by Reich and Tang. Of these, 48 are nonfinancials,
including such highly rated (P-l) issuers as Honda, Cargill, Automatic Data Processing, Merck, Google, Texas
Instruments, Cisco, Philip Morris International, eBay, Medtronic, Honeywell International, Target, and Campbell
Soup. Reich and Tang's list is also quite stable over time. On November 15, 2011, it had 164 approved issuers.
By December 27, 2012, over a year later, only 34 issuers were removed and 22 were added. Out of the removed
issuers, 16 were downgraded by Moody's to second tier, and nine were subsidiaries whose parents remain on the
list.</mixed-citation>

Funds report their category (e.g., prime, government, municipal) in item 10 of form N-MFP. We manually
examine all funds that ever report their category as prime to check for reporting errors. We manually identify
internal funds by looking up their profiles and by searching for them in the CRSP Mutual Fund database, which
does not cover internal funds. Variable annuities are identified in item 9 of form N-MFP. We also exclude two
funds that hold only cash during the whole sample period and seven prime muni funds, which we define as
prime funds that consistently invest more than 75% of their assets in municipal securities. Some of these funds
explicitly state that their investment objectives include "sustainability and social responsibility factors."</mixed-citation>

After applying our screens, aggregate assets of prime MMMFs are very close to the ICI numbers: $1,655 versus
$1,660 billion as of May 31, 2011. Before applying our screens, aggregate assets of prime MMMFs are larger
in N-MFP data than in ICI data. As of May 31, 2011, aggregate assets of prime MMMFs reporting on form
N-MFP are $1,875 billion, while they are $1,660 billion according to the ICI. Most of the difference is due to
the inclusion of internal funds in N-MFP data.</mixed-citation>

Form N-MFP provides us with issuer name, security CUSIP, if available, and issuer CIK if security CUSIP is
not available. Because a given issuer can have multiple issuer CUSIPs and because some instruments, such as
repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit, do not have CUSIPs, we use a number of other datasetsâthe
CUSIP master file, FISD, S&amp;P Ratings iQuery, the SEC's list of all CIKs matched with entity names, and datasets
of Fitch, Moody's, and S&amp;P credit ratings publicly available per Rule 17g-2âto link each security to the ultimate
parent of the issuer. For example, our algorithm attributes all of the following to BNP Paribas: CDs issued by
its Chicago, New York, and San Francisco branches (which have their own issuer CUSIPs), commercial paper
issued by BNP Paribas Finance, and repurchase agreements entered into by BNP Paribas Securities.</mixed-citation>

Furthermore, municipal issuers are generally small (the median municipal issuer borrows just $35 million from
prime MMMFs), are missing from the CUSIP master file most of the time, and have the most variation across

For example, three Morgan Stanley funds experience the largest inflows in our sample, with each fund more than
doubling in size. These apparent inflows are due to a one-time sweep of the cash balances of Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney clients into Morgan Stanley MMMFs in April 2011. Because this decision was made by Morgan
Stanley with investors having relatively little say in the matter, these fund flows are unlikely to be informative
about the general performance-flow relationship. Rather than make subjective judgements about such outliers,
we winsorize fund flows at the 5th and 95th percentiles. We obtain similar results when we winsorize at the 1st
and 99th percentiles.</mixed-citation>

For reference, Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2013) estimate that in the pre-crisis period a 10 basis point increase
in yield is associated with a 7% increase in fund assets on an annualized basis. Thus, the performance-flow
relationship was nearly twice as strong per basis point during March-May 2011 as it was during August 2007-
August 2008. This is consistent with the conjecture of Rajan (2006), who suggested that risk-taking incentives
in financial intermediaries may increase as nominal yields fall.</mixed-citation>

Similarly, we find that fund flows are more sensitive to exposures to banks in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and
Portugal, which not surprisingly were in significantly weaker financial condition, than to banks in other Eurozone
countries.</mixed-citation>

One may also wonder why MMMFs could not stem these outflows by reducing their exposures to Eurozone
banks. One answer is that secondary markets for large CDs and commercial paper are not very liquid (Covitz
and Downing 2007), so MMMFs trying to sell their Eurozone bank exposures would potentially have to do so
at significant discounts. A second answer is that risk taking by funds is persistent. In unreported results available
upon request, we find that the cross-sectional rank of funds by yield, a measure of risk, is highly persistent
over time. We also find that outflows around Lehman's bankruptcy, a proxy for risk taking before the crisis, are
strongly correlated with risk taking in the pre-period, both in the form of exposure to Eurozone banks and in
the form of lending through repo backed by highly distressed structured finance collateral. (See, for example,
Fitch Ratings (2012) on the risks of MMMFs lending against highly distressed structured finance collateral.) Our
results on persistence in risk taking are consistent with Fahlenbrach, Prilmeier, and Stulz (2012), who show that
a commercial bank's performance during the 1998 crisis predicts its performance during the recent crisis, though
their evidence shows persistence over a longer period than ours. In contrast, Strahan and Tanyeri (Forthcoming)
find that money funds that took on more risk leading up to Lehman's default did not invest in riskier assets in
the fall of 2008 after they were guaranteed by the government. This may be because funds feared the negative
stigma associated with actually using government guarantee.</mixed-citation>

Note, however, that the results in Table 3 suggest investors were not withdrawing from all funds that generally
invest in riskier assets, only from those with large exposures to Eurozone banks. Also, in Table 4, it is not the
case that riskier issuers, as proxied for by pre-period yield, experience larger declines in outstandings during the
post-period.</mixed-citation>

Based on data from the Investment Company Institute, over the 2008-2012 period the correlation between weekly
flows into institutional prime and institutional government MMMFs was â0.34. Substitution between prime and

Other similar proposals include Ricks (2011 ab), who calls for regulations similar to those governing commercial
banks for any issuer of short-term "money-like" claims; Gorton and Metrick (2010), who call for insurance of
money market funds to guarantee their investors payment and eliminate incentives to run; and McCabe, Cipriani,
Holscher, and Martin (2012), who call for a small fraction of each investor's recent balances to be set aside to
cover any losses if a fund has to be liquidated.</mixed-citation>
