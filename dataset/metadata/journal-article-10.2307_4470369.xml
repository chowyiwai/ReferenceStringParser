         <abstract>
            <p>Perhaps there are two great dangers in financial analysis: 1) Such growth oversimplification that the substance is missed because of the simplicity of the premise; and 2) Such detailed analysis that we cannot see the forest for the trees. This article suggests a middle ground, from the point of view of a management consultant who has looked at corporations for all kinds of investors as well as for the benefit of their own management. He takes a pragmatic point of view between these two extremes. In the article are many pointers to the analyst, particularly when interviewing corporate executives. These include: 1) How to assess corporate momentum at a point in time; 2) How to consider the shareholders' interests and if they are being served; 3) How to get at a company's basic raison d'etre of success or failure; and many other factors which may not have been used in the past by financial analysts in this particular way. The article should prove a useful adjunct to the review procedures now in use by the financial analysts of important corporations.</p>
