         <abstract>
            <p>The dramatic deterioration in state finances during the Great Recession raised concerns regarding government's ability to support community health and education. Because recessions differentially affect states with different tax structures, we could examine the effect of changes in state revenues on expenditures while controlling for demand-side factors that influence program utilization. We find that state revenue declines lead to short and long terms cuts in children's Medicaid benefits, and declines in elderly Medicaid enrollment. Larger cuts (nominal and proportional) in education spending versus Medicaid occurred. We suggest institutional, political, and economic constraints that may determine program cuts.</p>

Other papers have examined which expenditures programs are affected by the business cycle (for instance,
Hines Jr., Hoynes, and Krueger, 2001; Hercowitz and Strawczynski, 2004; Kane, Orszag, and Apostolov,
2005). However, we expect the business cycle to affect both revenues and the demand for government
services. Thus, without a measure of revenue swings it is difficult to attribute changes in expenditures
to revenue shortfalls versus changes in the demand for government services. In our paper we examine a
much larger portion of state budgets (general revenues versus just general fund revenues) over a much
longer time interval ( 1989-2012). 4"Not only is it difficult in some states to determine the constitutional or
statutory authority (for the balanced budget requirements), but often it is also unclear what the enforcement
mechanism is" (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2010, p. 10).</mixed-citation>

"General revenues" should not be confused with "general fund revenues" which are substantially lower
than general revenues, since they do not include earmarked funds, such as lottery revenue designated for
school spending. Further, balanced budget requirements usually impose restrictions on only general fund
revenues and expenditures. In an alternate specification that examines the robustness of our results, we
estimate Equation (1) using fixed effects instead of first differences and obtain similar results. For this case,
we specify balances in levels, as drawn from the National Association of State Budget Officers, Fiscal
Survey of States.</mixed-citation>
