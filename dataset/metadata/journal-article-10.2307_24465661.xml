         <abstract>
            <p>We test whether stock liquidity affects acquirer returns through its hypothesized effect on institutional monitoring. We find that firms with lower stock liquidity have higher acquirer gains for takeovers of private targets, but not for takeovers of public targets. The negative relation between liquidity and acquirer gains is stronger when the threat of disciplinary trading (exit) by institutions is weaker and acquirers have higher agency costs. Acquirers of private targets with lower stock liquidity are more likely to withdraw deals and experience higher involuntary CEO turnover following value-destroying acquisitions. Our results support the hypothesis that stock liquidity weakens institutions' incentives to monitor management decisions, except in those cases where the disciplining effect of the threat of exit may be particularly high.</p>

We do not view these results as consistent with a positive effect of stock liquidity on monitoring via voice (e.g.,
Faure-Grimaud and Gromb 2004), given that we find a negative relation between liquidity and announcement
returns for private acquisitions and that there is no theoretical prediction of the positive effect of liquidity on
voice being stronger in specific contexts, such as value-destroying acquisitions, as there is with the threat of exit
models.</mixed-citation>

Typically, this concern is addressed by employing an instrumental variable approach. Fang, Noe, and Tice
(2009), Fang, Tian, and Tice (2012), Bharath, Jayaraman, and Nager (2013), and Edmans, Fang, and Zur (2013)
use decimalization of stock prices as an instrument, but this is not feasible in our setting because ours is a
cross-sectional rather than a time-series analysis.</mixed-citation>

Fang, Tian, and Tice (2012) show that firm innovation diminishes with higher stock liquidity as ownership by
short-term oriented institutions increases. Note that their result is not inconsistent with exit models in which
blockholders are considered long-term institutions that have the option to exit in the short run, but will not exit
if managers maximize shareholder value.</mixed-citation>

We follow the definition first introduced by Bushee (1998), and further developed in Bushee (2001), who uses
principal component analysis based on a large number of variables for this classification. An institution is labeled
transient if it belongs to the group with higher share turnover and less concentrated holdings. These data are
kindly made available by Brian Bushee on his website (http://acct3.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/bushee/).</mixed-citation>

A number of alternative measures of liquidity have been used in the literature. However, the theories on the effect
of liquidity on institutional monitoring imply that large shareholders are mostly concerned with the price impact
of their trades (e.g., Maug 1998), which is well captured by the Amihud (2002) measure (Goyenko, Holden,
and Trzcinka 2009). In addition, to the extent that the Amihud (2002) measure captures trading costs or price
informativeness, it can also be used to test the prediction in Admati and Pfleiderer (2009) of a negative relation
between trading costs and institutional monitoring, and the prediction in Faure-Grimaud and Gromb (2004) of a
positive relation between price informativeness and institutional monitoring.</mixed-citation>

Given that, theoretically, illiquidity could be zero, the correct functional form is debatable. We therefore also
follow Chordia, Huh, and Subrahmanyam (2009) and Hasbrouck (1999, 2009) and employ a square root
transformation as a robustness check, and we find similar results. More details are provided in Section 4 of

When we estimate model (4) conditional on the availability of CEO Incentives, we find Stock Liquidity to be
insignificant, with a p-value similar to that in model (5). Adding CEO Incentives to the full sample regression
decreases the proportion of acquisitions of private targets. As shown in the next section, the coefficient on stock
liquidity remains significant at the 5% level when we add CEO Incentives to the specification for the sample of
acquisitions of private targets.</mixed-citation>

A private cost in this context may be the effort needed to screen out targets and negotiate better acquisition terms.

Ferreira, Ferreira, and Raposo (2011) measure price informativeness as the firm-specific stock return variation
calculated as the log (1 -R2/R2) where R2 is obtained from a regression regressing daily stock returns on the
daily returns of a value-weighted market index and asset-pricing factors. We use a period ending 46 days before
the announcement date with a minimum of 100 trading days and a maximum of 200 trading days. The three
asset-pricing factors we use are Fama and French's (1992) Small minus Big (SMB) and High minus Low (HML)
factors and the Carhart (1997) momentum factor.</mixed-citation>

Alternatively, we use the magnitude of exit, measured as the number of shares sold by the largest blockholder
as a percentage of the total number of shares outstanding as the dependent variable. The coefficient on acquirer
stock liquidity for OLS specifications for the subsample of value-destroying deals is 0.024, but statistically
indistinguishable from zero (p-value = 0.268). The results for the OLS exit regressions are available upon
request. We thank the referee for suggesting the exit tests.</mixed-citation>
