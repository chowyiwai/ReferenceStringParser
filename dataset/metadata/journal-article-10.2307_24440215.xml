         <abstract>
            <p>Conventional generational accounting only includes future benefits and burdens from the government. This paper's contribution is to include past benefits and burdens as well, and in this way to provide a full lifetime account of how much current and future generations benefit from government, in net terms, under various future policy lines. The calculations are carried out for the Netherlands and for the cohorts born since 1946. The more complete picture may be helpful for political decision-making on equitable intergenerational policies. A second contribution of this paper is that it uses a more comprehensive benefit concept than other such backward-looking studies by including non-cash benefits as well. The results point out that there are substantial differences in net lifetime benefits between generations and these are mainly driven by non-cash benefits such as education and healthcare, on which expenditure increased substantially after 1946.</p>

Non-tax revenues consist of revenues from natural resources (mainly gas), presented separately in
Table 1, and revenues from government financial assets, government sales and subsidies from the EU. In
the period 1948-51, they also include the Marshall aid, a US aid programme to rebuild the European
economies, which explains the high figure for 1950. The revenues from natural resources fluctuate due to
changes in the volume and price of sales. After 1951, the other non-tax revenues fluctuate mainly as a
result of fluctuations of holdings in and returns on financial assets.
In Table 1, non-tax revenues are not added to taxes but are subtracted from total expenditure. This
conforms with the way public finances are generally presented by CPB. This item, largely consisting of
government sales, can be seen as a counter item of direct government expenditure and serves as a
correction for the benefits from expenditure. Adding it to revenues might give a false and overstated
notion of the tax burden.</mixed-citation>

These age profiles are derived from various sources. The profile for healthcare consists of the profiles
for cure and care, which are both based on information provided by RIVM (2007). The age profiles for
the disability benefits are based on Van Sonsbeek and Alblas (2010), as is the future use of this
government programme. The profile for public pensions is based on their institutional arrangement.
Public pensions are granted to individuals from the age of 65. Being a flat-rate system other than granting
a higher benefit to single people than to married individuals, the average benefit is imputed to rise slightly
with age due to an increasing share of single households. The profiles for unemployment benefits and
social assistance are assumed flat between the ages of 20 and 64 due to lack of information.</mixed-citation>

The best practice might be to impute a different real discount rate for each year between 1946 and

This paper ignores the measures that were decided on after June 2010. These measures reduce the
sustainability gap by 3'/2 percentage points to 1 per cent of GDP. Including these measures would,
however, not change the intergenerational picture presented in Figure 5, as this only means that (part of)
