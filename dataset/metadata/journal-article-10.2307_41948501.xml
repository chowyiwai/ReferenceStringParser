         <abstract>
            <p>The AACSB, the global accreditation body for business education, expects business schools to prepare their students for future careers, by providing a total educational experience that emphasizes conceptual reasoning, problem-solving skills, and preparation for life-long learning. Achieving this "total educational experience" entails the development and acquisition of basic and disciplinespecifíc core competencies along with traditional university education that prepares "students to enter useful professional and societal lives". The paper focuses on the ability of University Trading Centers (UTCs) to successfully deliver needed core and professional managerial competencies. A skill-building model that merges lab technology, pedagogy, simulations, and experiential learning leading to managerial competencies is offered.</p>
