         <abstract>
            <p>In this paper, we offer and discuss new evidence on the performance of British Telecom (BT) before and after privatisation. We use a unique data-set based on company accounts over 40 years (1960–99) and original additional company data on several variables. We focus particularly on output, prices, revenues, costs, employment, productivity, profits and investment. Our key findings are that operating profits (i.e. gross profits before interest and tax) were remarkably stable before and after divestiture, and that ownership change per se had little discernible impact on productivity trends, particularly between 1984 and 1991. Major changes in performance after 1991 were, however, related to variations in financial arrangements, competition and regulatory pressure. This allows us to regard the BT case history as a natural experiment on the relative importance of privatisation, liberalisation and regulation.</p>

0ther interesting research strands on BT's performance, which we cannot discuss here but are worth
mentioning, are the following: international comparisons of telecommunications industry (e.g. Foreman-Peck
and Manning, 1988; Kwoka, 1993; Curwen, 1997; Hulsink, 1999; Boylaud and Nicoletti, 2000; Newbery,
2000); political economy and regulatory issues (e.g. Moon, Richardson and Smart, 1986; Pitt, 1990; Doyle,
1997; Cruickshank, 1998; Durant, Legge and Moussios, 1998); and accounting and management issues (e.g.
Penn, 1988; Antoniou and Pescetto, 1997; Puxty, 1997).</mixed-citation>

Prior to 1987, the BT Annual Reports carried only the data for Rentals. From 1987 onwards, when they were
broken down into a number of items, we needed to use some proxies. The greatest detail is provided in the
balance sheet for the year ending March 1988. In this, we find the turnover per division, and the Rentals
components can be found under the items Telephone exchange line rentals, Other network and Customers'
premises equipment supply. The total of these three items is listed per company and is therefore not netted off
the intercompany component as was done in later years. It was deemed appropriate to consider as Rentals the
gross turnover related to Telephone exchange line rentals and Customers' premises equipment supply, and the
rest was attributed to Other sales.</mixed-citation>

The standard method of calculation used for all tariffs until 31 July 1995 was based on a sum in pence per unit
consumed. This unit consisted of seconds of conversation, which varied according to the type of call — local,
national or international — and to the time the call was made. For international calls, the distance was
measured in chargebands made up of a number of countries at a similar distance. There were 10 bands up until
1991 and 19 thereafter, and a tariff is specified for every country in the world. There was also often a minimum
cost per conversation, with variations according to the type of contract signed by the subscriber which includes
various types of discounts. For details, see Florio (2002).</mixed-citation>
