For 1989, comparisons may be made on the basis of an exchange rate of 25 Czechoslovak crowns (Kcs) to
the £ sterling; in 1993 the market exchange rate averaged some 45 Czech crowns (Kc) to the £.</mixed-citation>

As in other socialist countries, the convention with the turnover tax was to express the rate as a percentage
of the tax-inclusive price rather than the tax-exclusive price. Thus, a turnover tax rate of 20 per cent (on the
tax-inclusive price) corresponds to a tax rate of 25 per cent on the basis usually employed in western Europe.</mixed-citation>

In May 1991, each of the turnover tax rates was reduced by 10 per cent, to reflect the unanticipated buoyancy
of public revenues; the rates thus became zero, 11 per cent, 20 per cent and 29 per cent.</mixed-citation>

As Hussain and Stern (1993) point out, the most unsatisfactory aspect of current west European practice is
in regard to property taxation. Hussain and Stern argue persuasively for introducing effective property taxes
in transition economies, starting with a simple definition of the tax base, and increasing in sophistication as
the property market develops. Governments should, they argue, retain some equity in housing, perhaps
through significant capital gains taxes applied to property transactions, since the initial prices at which
property is privatised are likely to severely understate long-term values. Property taxes were not part of the
initial bundle of fiscal reforms enacted in Czechoslovakia in 1992, and it is still unclear whether Czech and
Slovak legislation on the taxation of housing and other property will be able to improve on west European
practice.</mixed-citation>

The threshold is equivalent to some £33,000 at the market exchange rate, similar to the UK VAT registration
threshold of £36,600 at the start of 1993. Given the much lower wage and price levels in the Czech Republic,
however, the VAT registration threshold in the Czech Republic represents a significantly larger business than
the threshold in the UK.</mixed-citation>
