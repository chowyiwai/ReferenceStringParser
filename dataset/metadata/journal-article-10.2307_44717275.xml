         <abstract>
            <p>The automotive industry generally, and particularly those branches having to do with passenger cars and trucks, is today facing a number of vital problems which if not carefully and intelligently considered in all their phases, may have an adverse effect on not only the industry itself but on the economics of transportation. The first of these problems is the outgrowth of the banking policy instituted by the Federal Reserve Board to bring about a sounder financial condition of the country through a general restriction of credit which has taken the form of a discriminating attitude by many bankers toward the automobile industry. The second of the problems pertains to possible adverse legislation which may be the direct result of not only mistaken attitude but of incomplete study and investigation of features of highway transportation. The third problem is the rapid decline of our fuel reserve, indicating that unless our fuel production is enormously increased or conservation measures are instituted, a general restriction of the growth of the automotive industry will result. Each of these problems is of vital economic import and their equitable solution can be accomplished only when the status of the automotive industry in our present economic scheme and the value of the motor car as a means of travel and transportation are fully appreciated.</p>
