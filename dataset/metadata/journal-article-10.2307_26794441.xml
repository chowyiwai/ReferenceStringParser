         <abstract xml:lang="eng">
            <p>Many countries are concerned that they lose tax revenue from profit shifting by multinational firms, and have implemented transfer pricing legislations or thin capitalization rules in response. However, unilateral implementation of anti-avoidance rules may have negative impact on real investment and revenue, when multinational firms respond by cutting their investment and reducing their presence in the local economy. This paper uses a panel data on more than 250,000 companies in 60 countries over the years 2006-2015 to empirically investigate whether these laws reduce investment by multinational firms. We find that multinational affiliates respond to host-country transfer-pricing regulations by reducing their investment, which is likely shifted to other low-tax countries as there is no significant reduction in investment at the multinational group level. The effect on affiliate investment is concentrated in large, complex group, decreasing with the share of intangible asset, and is economically relevant.</p>
