         <abstract>
            <p>This paper develops and tests a new theoretical explanation for stock repurchases. Investors may disagree with the manager about the firm's investment projects. A repurchase causes a change in the investor base as investors who are most likely to disagree with the manager tender their shares. Therefore, a firm is more likely to buy back shares when the level of investor-management agreement is lower, and agreement improves as a consequence. Moreover, dispersion of opinion among investors cannot explain repurchase activity once the stock price and investor-management agreement are controlled for. Overall, the evidence is consistent with firms strategically using repurchases to improve alignment between management and shareholders.</p>

The 2003 dividend tax cut caused an increase in dividends, but there was also a simultaneous spike in repurchases
after the tax cut (Chetty and Saez 2005, 2006). Chetty and Saez (2006) suggest that repurchases may have
increased even more, absent the tax change. Dividend payments may also be affected by CEO overconfidence;
see Deshmukh, Goel, and Howe (2013).</mixed-citation>

Comment and Jarrell ( 1991 ) state that "the bulk of buy back activity is conducted through open-market repurchase
programs and dutch-auction self-tender offers, methods which have less signaling effectiveness than the
conventional fixed-price offer. This suggests that most stock buyback activity may be principally motivated by
objectives other than (or in addition to) signaling stock undervaluation." Accelerated share repurchase programs,
adopted in the last few years, may help get around some of these issues. See Bargeron, Kulchania, and Thomas
(2011) and Chemmanur, Cheng, and Zhang (2010) for a discussion.</mixed-citation>

The literature similarly argues that a problem with considering open-market repurchase programs as costly signals
is that the programs are not firm commitments, and thus the completion rate of these programs varies substantially
across companies. See, for example, Stephens and Weisbach (1998) and Rau and Vermaelen (2002).</mixed-citation>

Oded (2005) presents an asymmetric information-based signaling model to explain the positive announcement
returns of open-market repurchase programs. Yet the literature also documents several sources of announcement
returns that are unrelated to signaling. See Babenko (2009), Dittmar (2000), Grullon and Michaely (2004), and
Maxwell and Stephens (2003), among others. Further, Babenko, Tserlukevich, and Vedrashko (2012) suggest that
although managers may buy stock prior to a repurchase program announcement, such purchases are likely to be
motivated by personal wealth maximization rather than an intention to convey information. For an asymmetric
information justification for open-market repurchases that does not involve signaling, see Brennan and Thakor
(1990), who show that large shareholders will have an incentive to acquire costly information about the firm to
enable them to decide whether to tender their shares when the firm repurchases shares, whereas small shareholders
will prefer to avoid the information acquisition cost and remain uninformed. Thus, a repurchase creates a relative
advantage for large shareholders that dividends do not, and firms will repurchase shares when the preferences
of large shareholders dominate the firm's decision. Also, Constantinides and Grundy (1989) develop a model in
which firms simultaneously issue securities and repurchase stock and derive a separating equilibrium in which
insiders and outside investors end up with the same valuation of the firm.</mixed-citation>

Lie (2005) shows that firms with actual repurchases after open-market repurchase program announce-
ments experience improvements in operating performance relative to their control firms. However,
Gong, Louis, and Sun (2008) suggest that the reported improvement in operating performance is likely to be
driven by prerepurchase downward earnings management rather than genuine growth in profitability.</mixed-citation>

One concern arises that improvement in agreement might be negatively related to the prerepurchase agreement
mechanically in our empirical study due to the limitation in using proxies for agreement. For instance, in the
case of shareholder proxy proposal as an agreement proxy, the marginal effect of the incidence of receiving a
proxy proposal in one year on the incidence of receiving a proposal again in the following years might be well
less than one, because shareholders do not submit proposals frequently. As such, we focus on the analysis based
on the specification (13).</mixed-citation>

The idea behind this variable is that informed trading induces volatility (e.g., Glosten and Milgrom 1985; French
and Roll 1986) and idiosyncratic price changes mainly reflect private information being incorporated into stock
prices by informed trading (Roll 1988). See Ferreira and Laux (2007) for a reference of empirical evidence in
support of this informational interpretation of idiosyncratic volatility.</mixed-citation>

Intuitively, strong positive or negative reactions by the market around information-revealing events, such as
earning announcements, suggest a high information asymmetry between management and investors. So, as in
Dierkens ( 1991 ), the dispersion in the market reactions over a period is used as a proxy for information asymmetry.</mixed-citation>

We impose this more stringent criterionâ0.5% of the market capitalizationâfollowing the literature (e.g., Lie

By using net repurchases instead of raw repurchases, we focus on repurchases that are less likely to be motivated

Identifying an accurate measure of repurchases is empirically difficult. Banyi, Dyl, and Kahle (2008) find
higher error rates in commonly used estimators of share repurchases. Our measure here is an approximation
of open-market and privately-negotiated repurchases, as it may also include repurchases of securities other
than common stock. Despite being rare, we may have also omitted those open-market or privately negotiated
repurchases made in the same year of self-tender offer or Dutch auction repurchases. However, the prior literature
(e.g., Stephens and Weisbach 1998; Jagannathan, Stephens, and Weisbach 2000; Grullon and Michaely 2002)
suggests that transactions other than open-market repurchases represent only a small fraction of firms' repurchase
activity.</mixed-citation>
