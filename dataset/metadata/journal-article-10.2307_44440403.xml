            <p>THIS method has been developed in the Automotive Diesel Fuels Division of the Cooperative Fuels Research Committee and was released for publication at the Sept. 16 Meeting of the C.F.R. Committee following a demonstration meeting at Wood River, Ill., and a Division Meeting at the 1938 Summer Meeting of the Society. The method has been under development for some years by a Volunteer Group under the leadership of T. B. Rendel. ("Reports of the Volunteer Group for Compression-Ignition Research" were published in S.A.E. Transactions, June 1935, pp. 206-209; June 1936, pp. 225-233; January 1938, pp. 27-36; the first two by T. B. Rendel and the third by C. H. Baxley and T. B. Rendel.) This Group some time ago was taken up by the C.F.R. Committee as its Automotive Diesel Fuels Division. An Exchange Group to test the proposed method already has been joined by 21 laboratories. The proposed method also is published as an appendix to the 1938 Report of Committee D-2 on Petroleum Products and Lubricants of the A.S.T.M. for information only, or can be obtained from the A.S.T.M. in pamphlet form.</p>
