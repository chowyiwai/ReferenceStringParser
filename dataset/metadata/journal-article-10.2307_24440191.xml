         <abstract>
            <p>The existing literature either treats fundraising as an aggregate variable by ignoring the existence of several different fundraising methods through which charitable contributions are generated or focuses on the effectiveness of a particular fundraising method without making any comparison with alternative methods. Using biennial household surveys of charitable giving in the United States conducted from 1988 to 1999, which contain detailed questions on several fundraising methods, I first document that people are more responsive to certain fundraising methods. Next, I investigate the factors associated with donors' responsiveness to alternative fundraising techniques. The results show that several observable characteristics of charitable donors are associated with some people being more responsive to particular fundraising techniques than others are.</p>

Compared with the other editions, the wording of the questions on giving and volunteering to different
areas of charitable activity is slightly different in the 1988 edition. For this particular survey year, I
estimate total giving as the sum of money that the respondent has reported contributing to each of the
specific charity groups that they were asked about, excluding donations to political organisations. 1 also
exclude informal and work-related contributions, and contributions to friends, neighbours, relatives and

Donors were asked the following question: 'How was it you came to give to [name of the charitable
category]? Would you say that you decided to give on your own, responded to being asked by someone,
to a letter, (to a phone call), to an advertisement in the media, or to some other fundraising method?'
(donors were given the option to reply 'responded to a phone call' only in the 1990 edition). In both 1988
and 1990 editions, some respondents picked multiple choices and some others either did not answer this
question or said that they did not remember the catalyst for their donation. Since it is impossible to make
comparisons across donors who reported donating as a response to multiple fundraising methods, I only
consider those donors who reported giving as a response to a single fundraising method. As a result, I
deleted 1,251 observations.</mixed-citation>

The survey does not provide any information about the proportion of people who are approached to
give by different fundraising methods. If the proportion of people who are approached to give by a certain
fundraising method is significantly larger or smaller than the proportion who are approached to give by
other fundraising methods, then survey responses will reflect this fact. Therefore sample statistics should
be interpreted with caution. I acknowledge an anonymous referee for pointing out this caveat.</mixed-citation>

The wording of this question was as follows: 'How important is each of the following reasons to you
for contributing to a charitable organization? Receiving a letter asking you to give, receiving a phone call
asking you to give, someone coming to the door asking you to give, being asked at work to give, being
asked by someone you know well to give, seeing a television commercial asking you to give, reading a
newspaper or magazine advertisement asking you to give, reading or hearing a news story, being asked to
give in a telethon or radiothon, being asked by clergy to give, being asked by a celebrity to give either on
television, radio, or through the mail, reading about an opportunity or being solicited over the internet,
[and having] volunteered at the organization before. ' This question was not asked in the 1990 edition of
the survey. The 1988 edition included a similar question, but the wording of the question and the coding
of the responses were considerably different from in the other editions, so I exclude the responses from
this year.</mixed-citation>

Since the empirical analysis is based on self-reported survey data, the results may be prone to
measurement error and self-reporting bias. If self-reporting bias is correlated with the amount of
charitable contribution and the responsiveness to a certain fundraising method, then the empirical analysis
does not yield consistent estimates of the impact of alternative fundraising methods on the amount of
charitable contributions. Similarly, the empirical analysis is based on pooled cross-sectional data due to
the unavailability of panel data on alternative fundraising methods. Therefore, one cannot control for
individual fixed effects that may affect giving behaviour. If individual fixed effects or other unobserved
variables that may affect charitable behaviour are also correlated with respondents' responsiveness to
certain fundraising methods, then one cannot estimate the impact of alternative fundraising methods on
charitable giving using a simple regression model that assumes the exogeneity of fundraising methods.</mixed-citation>

Following the standard practice in the literature, 1 use the natural logarithm transformations of
household income and the tax price of giving. The selection of control variables is based on the earlier
literature that investigates the determinants of charitable giving. Andreoni (2006) provides a detailed
discussion of this literature. Religious attendance is documented to be an important determinant of
charitable giving (Gruber, 2004; YÃ¶rÃ¼k, 2009). YÃ¶rÃ¼k (2011) argues that people who have lived in their
community longer are more integrated into their neighbourhood and are more likely to receive certain
types of charitable requests such as personal solicitations.</mixed-citation>

A potential problem in equation (1) is the endogeneity of the tax price of giving. A widely-used
instrument for the last-dollar price of giving in the literature is the first-dollar price, which excludes the
charitable contributions. Since the main variable of interest is not the tax price, instrumenting this variable
with the first-dollar price or, alternatively, excluding it from the empirical analysis has a very minor
impact on the estimated effects of fundraising methods on charitable behaviour. For instance, when I
exclude the tax price from the regression and re-estimate equation (1), I find the coefficients and standard
errors on alternative fundraising methods to be as follows: asked by someone = -0.409 (0.170); direct-
mail solicitation = -0.566 (0.356); media ad = -1.015 (0.276); and other fundraising method = -0.353
(0.096). These estimates are quite similar to the results reported in the first column of Table A2.
Furthermore, tests find that the differences between the alternative estimates are statistically insignificant.
I also instrument the last-dollar price with the first-dollar price and re-estimate equation (1). Again, the
coefficients on alternative fundraising methods remain quite similar to those reported in Table A2. This
analysis suggests that potential problems due to the possible endogeneity of the tax price have no
significant effect on the estimated coefficients of alternative fundraising methods.</mixed-citation>

I have also estimated alternative models that control for the possibility of donating money as a
response to multiple fundraising methods. As additional covariates, these models included interaction
dummies that control for each possible combination of fundraising methods. However, in these models,
the coefficients on interaction dummies were mostly insignificant, which suggests that interaction among
alternative fundraising strategies does not play an important role in charitable contributions. These results

If some unobserved covariates are correlated with the amount of donation and responsiveness to a
certain fundraising method, then matching-adjusted estimates are biased. The empirical analysis focuses
on four fundraising methods: personal solicitations, mail solicitations, media ads and telephone
solicitations. YÃ¶rÃ¼k (2012) shows that solicitations via media are random and matching estimators should
provide a reliable estimate. It is plausible that people who are more likely to give are also more likely to
receive personal, mail or telephone solicitations. However, the outcome variable in the empirical analysis
is the amount of charitable contributions of those who are already donors. Therefore, a possible selection
problem is partially controlled for due to the nature of the outcome variable.</mixed-citation>
