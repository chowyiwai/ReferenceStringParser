         <abstract>
            <p>Until the end of the 1990s, the existence of a negative relationship between banking competition and stability was generally accepted in the economic literature. Since then, a new point of view has emerged questioning this relationship and instead argues about the existence of a positive relationship between these two variables. This paper studies the impact of the heterogeneity in market power on this relationship through the case of the Chilean banking sector. The results indicate that this kind of heterogeneity can play an important role in the relationship between risk taking and competition.</p>

The C5 index measures the market share deposits of the five biggest banks. In particular,
the main five Chilean banks in the period in analysis are Santander-Chile bank, Bank of Credit
and Investments (BCI), Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria bank (BBVA), Bank of Chile, and Bank of the
State of Chile. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index is a measure of the size of all firms in relation to
the industry. These indexes were elaborated using date from the Chilean Superintendency of Banks
and Financial Institutions (www.sbif.cl).</mixed-citation>

The fixed effect approach of this panel data is more efficient than the random effect approach
according to the Hausman test. Problems with contemporary correlation, heteroskedasticity, and
serial self-correlation were detected and subsequently resolved through the robust estimation of
the variance-covariance matrix.</mixed-citation>
