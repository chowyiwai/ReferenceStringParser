         <abstract>
            <p>After a period of consultation, it has been decided that the Revenue should be empowered to issue legally-binding rulings in favour of taxpayers only where the relevant transaction has already taken place. This paper considers the reasons for having binding rulings, and argues that those reasons justify implementing pre- as well as post-transaction rulings. Additionally, it is contended that many of the more detailed aspects of the proposal warrant reconsideration in light of those underlying rationales.</p>

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (New Zealand) is enabled by the Tax Administration Amendment Act
1995 (ss. 91A to 911) to make binding rulings on how taxation laws apply to any person(s) or arrangement. The
legislation was implemented in two stages: (a) from 1 April 1995, enabling all rulings except private rulings on
arrangements entered into before the date on which the Commissioner received the application for the ruling
and (b) from 1 April 1996, for private rulings on arrangements entered into before the date on which the
Commissioner received the application for the ruling.</mixed-citation>

Canada and the US have operated systems of self-assessment for many years, while Australia is gradually
moving towards a system of 'full' self-assessment (see the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self-Assessment) Act
which passed into Australian law on 30 June 1992). New Zealand has recently recognised the need for a
'formal' self-assessment system which is yet in its developmental stage: Taxpayer and Compliance, Standards
and Penalties 2: Detailed Proposals and Draft Legislation, A Government Discussion Document (Government
Printer, Wellington, April 1995) at p. 45. Britain has just implemented a limited form of self-assessment for the
1996-97 tax year. The importance of advance rulings for the process of self-assessment is referred to by the
Financial Secretary, Michael Jack MP, in his foreword to Pre-Transaction Rulings.</mixed-citation>

This promise was made by the Inland Revenue (jointly with HM Customs &amp; Excise) in its Taxpayers
Charter, published in August 1991. The Revenue's continuing commitment to the Charter was emphasised, in
the wake of self-assessment, in Simons Tax Intelligence 1996 at p. 725. It is noteworthy, too, that there is to be
no transfer of responsibility to calculate the taxpayer's liability: indeed, 'obvious arithmetical mistakes will be
corrected by the Revenue' (Simons Direct Tax Service E. 1.806 at p. 1808). The responsibility, in effect, is
simply to make a 'return of information which may be reasonably required for the purpose of establishing the
amounts chargeable to income tax and capital gains tax for a year of assessment and the amount payable by
way of income tax for that year' (ibid, at p. 1806).</mixed-citation>

One effect of having to do so would be that the taxpayer would not be able to avail himself of consistency in
the administrative systems for (formal) pre- and (informal) post-transaction rulings. By way of example, the
range of matters on which the Revenue might not be prepared to rule is likely to differ. This, of course, is
hardly likely to assist the goal of tax simplification.</mixed-citation>

increased from 20 per cent in 1980 to approximately 72 per cent in 1992. See Sandford and Wallschutzky,

applying the rule strictly that applications for rulings must be accompanied by a draft ruling citing case
authority and legal principles in support of the desired ruling (including any authority that is unfavourable to
the application). Compare the New Zealand position, where the Commissioner is allowed to waive these
