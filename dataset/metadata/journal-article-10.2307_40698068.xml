         <abstract>
            <p>This study reviews the literature and the practice of accounting for research and development (R&amp;D) costs from the first reference in 1917 to the current treatment. The conceptual treatment of R&amp;D is compared to current financial accounting rules and explanation of the evolution of the current rules is presented. The economic and social consequences of the current rules which require R&amp;D costs to be expressed are examined. The paper explores possible alternative treatment of R&amp;D costs. As a contrast to U. S. practice, the accounting treatment of R&amp;D costs in other countries is discussed. Given the findings of this paper, a strong case can be made for changing the way that R&amp;D costs are accounted for in the United States.</p>
