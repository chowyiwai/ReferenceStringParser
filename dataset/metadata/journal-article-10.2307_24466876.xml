         <abstract>
            <p>Using a sample of non-U.S. firms from 43 countries, we investigate whether laws and regulations as well as votes cast by U.S. institutional investors are consistent with an effective shareholder voting process. We find that laws and regulations allow for meaningful votes to be cast, as shareholder voting is both mandatory and binding for important elections. For votes cast, we find there is greater dissent voting when investors fear expropriation. Further, greater dissent voting is associated with higher director turnover and more M&amp;A withdrawals. Our results suggest that shareholder voting is an effective mechanism for exercising governance around the world.</p>

A recent cross-border example of these dynamics, involving a U.S. acquirer, was Kraft's acquisition of Cadbury.
Kraft revised the initial offer to finance the acquisition with less than 20% of stock to circumvent the requirement
of shareholder approval of the deal. This strategy was strongly opposed by Warren Buffett, the largest shareholder
of Kraft. This and other approaches seem rather common in the United States; for example, Hsieh and Wang
(2008) report that only 53% of the acquisitions required shareholder approval in the United States during the
1990 to 2005 period.</mixed-citation>

We exclude votes of shareholder-initiated proposals in our final sample but note here that our results are also robust
to including them. We also remove the small number of management-initiated proposals that occur in tandem
with a shareholder-initiated proposal for the same agenda item that is opposed by management (161 firm-year
observations) because there is a mechanical relationship of lesser shareholder support for these management-
initiated proposals. For evidence on shareholder-initiated proposals, see Alexander, Chen, Seppi, and Spatt

For robustness, we use a threshold measure of Insider control that equals one if a firm's Insider control is larger
than the sample median value of Insider Control, and zero otherwise. This alternative measure of Insider control
is negatively and significantly (/Â»-value &lt;0.01) associated with Voting for, confirming our findings. We also note
that while it may be interesting to compare our non-U.S. results with prior U.S. results, it is not possible to do
so directly because the managerial entrenchment measures, as well as other data, are different between our tests
and those conducted for U.S. firms' director voting patterns by Cai, Garner, and Walkling (2009).</mixed-citation>

Because tests conducted by Aggarwal, Erel, Stulz, and Williamson (2010) imply that investors would be more
concerned with managerial entrenchment when country institutions are weak, while research by Bergman
and Nicolaievsky (2007) and Doidge et al. (2007) implies the opposite, in untabulated models we test the
interdependence between firm-level and country-level investor protection. For each country-level protection
variable, we estimate models with that variable, Insider control, and an interaction term between these variables,
along with the prior control variables. We find that the standalone coefficients retain significance but the
interaction term is generally insignificant, which suggests that the effect of firm-level managerial entrenchment
on shareholder votes cast in corporate elections is largely independent of country-level institutions.</mixed-citation>

While studies of whether shareholder voting patterns are linked to changes in executive compensation are also
informative, we do not analyze this topic because executive compensation packages are disclosed in relatively
few countries (Fernandes, Ferreira, Matos, and Murphy 2013) and compensation votes are rarely mandatory and
binding (Correa and Lei 2014). Evidence shows that shareholders in U.S. and U.K. firms provide less support
for equity compensation plans that are excessive or dilutive (see, e.g., Morgan, Poulsen, and Wolf 2006; Carter
and Zamora 2009; Ertimur, Ferri, and Muslu 2011; Armstrong, Gow, and Larcker 2013).</mixed-citation>

Similarly, in June 2005, U.S. institutional investors were influential and pivotal for the rejection of "poison
pill" proposals in Yokogowa Electric Corp. and Fanuc Ltd. Sixty-four percent of Yokogawa's U.S. institutional
investors voted against the proposal, and less than 20% of U.S. funds voted in favor of management of Funac. In
both firms, according to reports, the two-thirds majority was again only missed by fractional margins, attributing
a crucial and pivotal role to these U.S. institutions that voted their shares against these proposals.</mixed-citation>

The ISS Voting Analytics database provides a brief description for each agenda item, but it does not provide the
exact text including the director name. A potential concern is that when new directors are nominated there is more
likely to be dissent, perhaps because of poor firm performance, which could lead to a mechanical relation between
voting and turnover. However, prior findings by Cai, Garner, and Walkling (2009) show that new directors get
higher total shareholder support than incumbent directors, and Iliev and Lowry (2014) show that the same is
true when focusing on just institutional investor votes. Further, our models control for firm-level factors like past
performance that could lead to a change in directors.</mixed-citation>

While we explicitly control for firm performance, for robustness we also use the method employed in Cai, Garner,
and Walkling (2009). Specifically, we estimate a regression of Voting for directors on prior-year industry-adjusted
Profitability and Excess stock return, as well as industry, country, and year dummies. Using the residual from
this regression as measure of shareholder voting for directors confirms our results from Table 5 (not tabulated
for brevity).</mixed-citation>

Following Ai and Norton (2003), Norton, Wang, and Ai (2004), Greene (2010), and Karaca-Mandic, Norton, and
Dowd (2012), we define a model with an interaction term as E[y x,*2, Z] = F (Ã x +Ã2x2+Ã2(x x X2)+S'Z),
where x (Voting for directors) and *2 (U.S. institutional ownership) are the variables of interest, Z is a set of
control variables, F(.) is a Poisson (exponential) transformation, and Ã, Ã2, and 8' are regression coefficients.
Letting v=Ãx +Ã2x2+Ãl2(xl the marginal effect of Voting for directors Oq) on the conditional
expected value of Director turnover (y ) is calculated asdE[yx,X2,Z]/dx=dF/dvxdv/dx=dF/dvx(Ã +
Ã2xl)- In a nonlinear model dF/dv^ 1,and the marginal effect of Voting for directors (jcj ) is not a constant, but
instead depends on the values not only of x (Voting for directors) but also X2(U.S. institutional ownership), and
more generally, on all the other included control variables. Thus, relying on the coefficient estimates from the
regression output of this nonlinear model can be misleading for making inferences. In contrast, in a linear model
dF/dv= 1,and the marginal effect of x is Ã +Ã2X2- This expression varies linearly with X2 (U.S. institutional
ownership) but it is the same for any values of x (Voting for directors) and any other covariÃ¢tes.</mixed-citation>

As discussed in Section 1.1, it is difficult to verify that all acquirer votes that we observe in the dataset are indeed
mandatory and binding. However, while our research design intends to use only mandatory votes because these
represent the strongest test of whether the shareholder voting process works for non-U.S. firms, the possible
inclusion of some nonbinding votes may not matter given prior work showing that advisory-only votes can
impact firm outcomes (see, e.g., Cunat, Gine, and Guadalupe 2012; Ertimur, Ferri, and Muslu 2011; Ferri and
Maber 2013).</mixed-citation>

Since our sample of target firms are public and we exclude tender-offer deals, we do not add the usual dummy
variables for private target firm and tender-offer deals. Further, for target firms, in unreported regressions, we
also control for the logarithm of the total deal value and confirm our results. We choose not to include this control
in our target-firm regressions because it is missing for about 26% of our observations.</mixed-citation>
