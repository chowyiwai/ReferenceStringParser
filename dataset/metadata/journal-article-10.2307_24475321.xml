         <abstract>
            <p>This study investigates the roles of indicators, time-series analysis, and estimation techniques in economic freedom–growth relationship. We construct a new freedom index using annual data from Turkey between 1970 and 2006. The index consists of six components: government size, market intervention, soundness of the money and banking system, freedom of capital markets, freedom to trade, and institutional structure. The empirical results indicate that the relationship between economic freedom and per capita income is sensitive to indicators and estimation techniques. We also summarize the emerging process of a market economy and its accompanying growth performance.</p>

Literacy rate, average years of education, and school enrollment rate are often used as a
proxy for human capital stock. Literacy rate covers the entire population, some of which may not
be in the labor force (such as homemakers and the disadvantaged), and is not a good indicator of
the productivity of the labor supply. The Turkish Institute of Statistics does not publish data on
average years of education. The United Nations Development Programme publishes data but in
five-year intervals, which is not suitable for time-series analyses, and it covers the entire population
(not available specifically for the labor force). Thus, the schooling rate at primary level is widely
employed in growth regressions.</mixed-citation>

The economic freedom index includes variables such as public investment expenditures,
subsidies, public savings, and foreign direct investment, which may affect aggregate capital stock.
Thus the index might pick up the effect of capital stock and yield to an underestimation of its co-
efficient. The correlation coefficient between the index and capital stock is 0.67 and between the
index and human capital stock is 0.77, thereby giving support to that possibility.</mixed-citation>

The variables GOVERN and CAPITAL are 1(0) as can be seen in Table 4. Pesaran et al.
(2001) warn about the reliability of the estimates in the case of models with mixed 1(0) and 1(1)
variables. Thus, the interpretation of models 2 and 5 requires caution.</mixed-citation>

A time-series analysis with thirty-seven data points may suffer from small-sample bias. Re-
imers (1992) states that the Johansen procedure overrejects when the null is true and thus suggests
taking account of the number of parameters to be estimated in the model and making an adjustment
for degrees of freedom by replacing T in the Johansen trace and A.-max statistics by T- np, where
T is the sample size, n is the number of variables in the model, and p is the lag length set. In the
current study, the null of no cointegration has already been rejected according to at least one of
either trace or X-max statistics; therefore, an adjustment is not needed. In addition, the availability
of data for the construction of the freedom index with twenty-eight components constrained us.
We are aware of the small-sample bias.</mixed-citation>
