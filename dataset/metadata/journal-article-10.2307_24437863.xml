The prospect of reduced social security should induce people to raise their private saving, following the standard
argument of Feldstein (1974), as should greater government indebtedness to finance pre-committed social security
(Barro, 1974). But the prospect of greater uncertainly attached to social security should, if individuals are
risk-averse, also raise private saving: for a discussion of this in the Italian context, see Brugiavini (1987) and
Jappelli and Pagano (1994).</mixed-citation>

Clearly, if there is a strong bequest motive, assets will not be fully decumulated. This is discussed further below.
Under certain assumptions concerning the utility function, and a perfect capital market, the individual will invest
all his or her savings in annuities (Yaari, 1965). However, if there is a precautionary motive for saving, the mix
of annuitised and financial wealth will change over the life cycle (Carroll and Samwick, 1993; Engen, 1993). An
imperfectly-functioning annuity market will also affect precautionary saving (Davies, 1981).</mixed-citation>

In both Italy and Japan, it is argued that the life-cycle timing of saving for house purchase is very different from
the 'Anglo-Saxon' model. For example, if, as in Italy, parents undertake house purchase for their children, the
extent of net wealth accumulation in Figure 2 will be reduced. In countries such as Japan where greater saving for
house purchase is required, the wealth trajectory may not even be single-peaked. But these points should not detract
from the general relationship between household saving and aged dependency put forward in the text.</mixed-citation>

There are, of course, a number of methods of measuring the savings rate. Countries where a high degree of
institutional saving is done through, for example, pension funds or state-run provident institutions may report lower
household savings rates. In countries where pensions are largely provided from state-run Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)
schemes, higher aged dependency is associated with higher tax rates.</mixed-citation>

A similar point about Japanese savings rates relative to other OECD countries is made in OECD (1990).
However, the regression results in that report are even less robust than the simple bivariate model reported here.</mixed-citation>

Relative to the US, and for the period 1977-92, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark and Greece had significantly higher household savings rates, and Finland and Holland significantly lower
rates, ceteris paribus. The other seven countries had insignificantly different savings rates from that of the US.</mixed-citation>

This is known as 'backloading' of pension accruals, i.e. accrual of pension rights is not proportionate to the
amount put in each year in a final salary plan. See, inter alia, Bodie, Macus and Merton (1988), Ippolito (1985)

Bemheim (1989) fails to confirm this last hypothesis for the US, but it has not as yet been tested on British data.
Current work at the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the 1994-95 reinterview data for the Retirement Survey may
shed some light on this.</mixed-citation>
