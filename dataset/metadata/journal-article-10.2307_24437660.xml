         <abstract>
            <p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the reform of family benefits and the growth of means-testing in Hungary. From 1996, many family benefits were means-tested for the first time. A new microsimulation model for Hungary, running on recent survey microdata, is used to simulate the impact of the 1996 reforms on government expenditures, the distribution of incomes, the targeting of benefits and effective marginal tax rates. These reforms are found to be largely benign and even progressive, but they also appear to be paving the way for the further extension of means-testing. The model is used to investigate such an extension by simulating the impact of a UK-style system of means-tested family benefits in Hungary. This system achieves some expenditure savings and better targeting of benefits, but also greatly increases effective marginal tax rates on low-income households with children. The paper argues that resulting poverty traps may increase child poverty in Hungary in the longer term and cautions against the overextension of means-testing.</p>

Evidence from the 1987 and 1995 HBSs does suggest, however, that women's withdrawal from the labour
market was more selective than that of men, in that women in unskilled blue-collar occupations were more
likely to leave the labour force than unskilled blue-collar men.</mixed-citation>

ln 1995 and 1996, the minimum pension was HUF 9,600 per month (average net earnings were HUF 31,100
per month in 1996). It has been standard practice in Hungary to equivalise household needs on a per capita
basis. A more detailed description of Family Allowance before and after April 1996 is provided in Redmond
(1998).</mixed-citation>

As an earnings-related benefit, GYED was taxable, while, as a means-tested benefit, GYES is not taxable but
subject to a 6 per cent social insurance contribution. Simulated income tax revenues decrease by HUF
billion as a result of this reform, so the net simulated saving in expenditure is just over HUF 14 billion.</mixed-citation>
