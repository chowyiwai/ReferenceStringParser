         <abstract>
            <p>The balloon tire has run the gauntlet of skepticism and credulity and has received scientific and popular approval from engineers and car-owners. The reasons for its acceptance are satisfactory appearance, practicability and transportation comfort. Tire and rim sizes, masquerading for years under wrong dimensional markings, have caused immeasurable inconvenience. This condition resulted from poor standards or entire lack of standards supervision. A committee with backbone is needed to fix and to maintain standards. Rapid balloon-tire tread-wear depends on tread profile, pressure and movement. Increased inflationpressure and a scientifically designed tread will reduce the rapidity of this wear. Tread-contact areas and pressures are pictured to explain the advantages of a properly designed tread, and to demonstrate that the casing carries an appreciable part of the tire load. Tread configuration should assure traction, flexibility, easy steering, and good wear and should be not too rugged. Tread surface should be largely non-skid for best all-year and all-highway service. The public is confused by diverse balloon-tire inflation-pressure tables offered toy tire and vehicle makers. One standard table can and should be adopted for all balloon tires. Increasing the number of plies in a balloon tire in creases the ease of entry of a puncturing object into the tread, but decreases the probability of complete penetration and actual deflation from puncture. Gradual loss of air from tires is due chiefly to diffusion through the tube rubber. The rate depends on daily mileage, road conditions and tube quality and thickness. Average diffusion amounts to from 1 to 5 lb. per week. Volume of noise in closed cars is no greater with balloon tires than with high-pressure tires, as indicated by audiometer measurements. Different cars show important differences in noise volume, due principally to differences in engines. Balloon tires are not a fundamental cause of shimmying. Improper balance between front-end units appears to offer the chief cause. There is no common remedy. More original and thorough research by experts in their particular fields is urged so that America will lead in the refinement as well as in the production of tires and automobiles.</p>
