         <abstract>
            <p>Conventional wisdom suggests that high-reputation banks will generally produce good securities to maintain their long-run reputation. We show with a simple model that, when securities are complex a high-reputation bank may produce assets that underperform during market downturns. We examine this possibility using a unique sample of $10.1 trillion of CLO, MBS, ABS, and CDOs. Contrary to the conventional view, securities issued by more reputable banks did not outperform but, rather, had higher proportions of capital in default.</p>

We note here that having the price set by the commitment type will in effect pin down the price charged for all
securities. Therefore, prices will in a sense not respond to investors' equilibrium beliefs about the behavior of
strategic players or the fraction of commitment types in the economy. Our main results are robust to an alternative
setting in which commitment types adjust their behavior to reflect the ex ante expected payoff from dealing with
a reputable underwriter relative to a low-reputation underwriter.</mixed-citation>

Some of the student loans that are found in the collateral pool of student loan ABS in fact carry a guarantee by
the Department of Education, which was enforced through various government related entities (Sallie Mae being
one of them). Because the guarantee was not for 100% of the value of the loan, and because of the difficulty in
distinguishing between securities backed by loans issued under FFELP and private loans, we leave student loans
ABS in the sample.</mixed-citation>

We have collected industry classification information for each underwriter from Bloomberg. Bloomberg
classifies financial institution into ten main categories: Commercial Banks, Commercial Services, Diversified
Operations, Finance-Commercial, Finance-Investment Banking, Institutional Brokerage, Advisory Services,
Investment Management, Life Insurance, and Wealth Management. We classify Finance-Investment Banking
and Institutional Brokerage as investment banks. This list includes Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers
and other smaller shops, for example, Warburg Dillon Read and William R. Hough. Examples of institutions that
are not classified as investment bank are Chase Manhattan Bank, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Credit Lyonnais and
others.</mixed-citation>

In additional analyses reported in the Internet Appendix, we use a secondary measure of performance based on
the deal rating, which is constructed by calculating a value-weighted average rating score of all the tranches that
belong to each particular deal. We compute the difference between the rating deal as of December 2010 and the
rating deal at issuance. This measure has the advantage of being continuous and capturing minor events that may
not lead to default and the disadvantage of depending on the initial rating of the securities at issuance.</mixed-citation>

Often, rating agencies interrupt the rating service by effectively withdrawing the rating. This might happen for
two reasons: the security might be in default and the deal manager thus stopped paying the rating fee, or the
deal is fully repaid. If the final balance of the security (which is also available through Bloomberg) reports both
a positive outstanding value and losses, and all ratings are withdrawn, then we consider the security to be in
default. If the balance is zero and there are no reported losses, we consider the security to be repaid in full with
a rating equal to the last known rating.</mixed-citation>

A large fraction of the securities have floating rates in the form of a spread to LIBOR. For those securities we
compute the yield by first finding the comparable swap rate (fix to LIBOR). We then add back the spread and
subtract LIBOR. For fixed rate securities, we compute yields in the traditional way and then subtract LIBOR.
We then compute a principal weighted average to determine a yield spread at the deal level.</mixed-citation>

Because rating agencies are more likely to make positive adjustments on deals with a lower proportion of model
generated AAA (Griffin and Tang 2012), it would make more sense for an issuer to take a weak deal structure
(which deserves a smaller amount of AAA) and work for an upward positive adjustment. This might leave the
issue's proportion of AAA similar to other deals.</mixed-citation>
