         <abstract>
            <p>The Research Institute of NHTSA has been conducting dynamic sled tests of advanced and/or passive belt restraint systems for compact or subcompact cars. Phase I tests using dummies have been completed for eleven systems which were submitted by six different manufacturers. Test results are reported. Phase II tests using volunteer human subjects are now in progress for systems which generated good performance data during Phase I tests. The results of human tests of the first system have been very encouraging. Successful injury-free tests of one volunteer subject have been completed with a maximum attained velocity of 30.4 mph (48.9 km/hr) at an acceleration level of 21.1 G. Only the results taken from "quick-look" preliminary data are reported. Suggestions are made for additional research, development, and test efforts to optimize the performance characteristics of future belt restraint systems and to improve their comfort and convenience.</p>
