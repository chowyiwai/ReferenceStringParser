            <p>This study is the first to explore the relationship between school district income taxes and school inputs (expenditures and student–teacher ratios) using Ohio as a case study. The study employed reduced-form expenditure functions on a data panel of 609 school districts between 1990 and 2010. Treating for the endogeneity of school district income taxes, we found that income tax adopters in Ohio spent $0.20 of a dollar of the tax revenue on operating purposes, and they spent four-fifths of this $0.20 on instructional services that were likely to induce gains in student achievement. Also, we found ambiguous evidence on the effect of income tax revenues on student–teacher ratios.</p>

Thirty-seven states provided less funding per pupil to local school districts in 2009 than in 2008
(Oliff and Leachman 2011). In the first quarter of 2012, real local property tax collections across the
nation declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, by 2.8% relative to 2011 (Dadayan 2012). Property
taxes remain, however, a dominant local source of revenues for school districts. On average, property
taxes contributed about 65% of all locally generated education revenue in 2010 and 2011 nationwide
(United States Census Bureau 2012,2013).</mixed-citation>

This study does not examine the effects of local income taxes on student outcomes for two major
reasons. First, data on test scores are not available for the first 11 years of our sample period (1990-2010).
Second and more important, it is not additional funds, but rather expenditures and how the funds are
spent that really matter in raising student outcomes. Traditional education production functions include
expenditures (not a variable indicating revenue) as a key explanatory variable.</mixed-citation>

Districts can put both a property tax reduction (partial or complete) and income tax increase
on a single ballot, or income taxes on a separate ballot from that for property taxes. This is different
from, for instance, Iowa. School districts in Iowa can use the district income tax funds only to initiate
discretionary educational improvement programs as long as there is an accompanying property tax
increase.</mixed-citation>

Municipalities in Ohio were allowed to levy an income tax much earlier. Toledo was the first to
adopt the tax in 1946; other adoptions followed, for example, in Columbus, Springfield, and Youngstown
in 1948 and Dayton and Warren in 1949 (Taylor 1962). In 2009, 577 municipalities (236 cities and 341
villages) levied the tax (Ohio Department of Taxation 2011). Also, because a municipality's boundary
may overlap or cut across multiple school districts, it appears that municipal income taxes have little
bearing on district income taxes.</mixed-citation>

Earned income is defined as salaries, wages, self-employment income, and other types of employee
compensation (e.g. tips), and thus excludes other types of income such as retirement income or lottery
winnings. However, as of the end of the 2009 fiscal year, voters in only 19 school districts had approved
earned-income-only tax bases (Ohio Department of Taxation, 2010). This small number does not allow
for a precise test on potentially differential effects of income tax bases (traditional v. earned income) on
educational spending.</mixed-citation>

The income tax vote is on whether a district will have an income tax at a specified rate. However,
before putting the income tax on the ballot, a district's board of education must pass a resolution
indicating a specified amount of money to be raised by the tax. A tax commissioner then certifies this
resolution and determines the income tax rate. The final resolution available to district residents in an
election includes the specified amount to be raised at a specific tax rate.</mixed-citation>

transportation fees, book rentals, athletic event admissions, club dues, food sales, and facility leasing.

A linear trend variable serves to control for common factors that affect all districts and that change
at a constant rate year-on-year. Year fixed effects, t, controls for common shocks to all districts in a
particular year. Therefore, year fixed effects (conditional on the linear trend) pick up the effects of the
common factors that do not change at a constant rate. Several studies (e.g., Autor, 2003), have controlled
for both year fixed effects and linear trends.</mixed-citation>

Stata, the statistical software we use for empirical work, provides Kleibergen and Papp's (2006) rk
statistic in the case of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (HAC) standard errors. Critical values to
identify weak IVs for endogenous variables with HAC standard errors are, however, still an open area
of research. Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman (2007) suggest applying Stock and Yogo's (2005) critical values
for the homoscedastic case to the rk statistic with caution. The rk statistic of 620 in column 3 is much
larger than the critical value of 11.04 used to reject a 5% maximal relative bias from weak IVs for two
endogenous variables. The results in the first stage can be provided upon request.</mixed-citation>

Bootstrapping, which was formally introduced in Efron (1979), is a form of resampling the
original dataset to produce a series of datasets from which the standard error of an estimate is derived.
Block bootstrap, a variant of bootstrap, is done by maintaining the autocorrelation structure of the same
group (i.e., school districts) (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004).</mixed-citation>
