         <abstract>
            <p>Particulate matter (PM) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured under steady state engine operating conditions in the exhaust of a DI diesel engine that meets the Japanese 1994 heavy-duty vehicle standards. In this study, to examine and discuss the effects of pyrene and sulfur contents in fuels on PM and PAH emissions, experiments were performed using both ordinary diesel fuel and a specified fuel having simple hydrocarbon components and very few aromatics. In the experiments, pyrene and sulfur contents in the fuels were changed by the addition of reagents to the fuel. The following conclusions were obtained. (1) From the experiments using ordinary JIS No. 2 diesel fuel with a pyrene reagent added to yield 400ppm pyrene, it was found that pyrene addition brings about an increase in soluble organic fraction (SOF) under low load engine operating conditions. On the other hand, soot remarkably increased under high load conditions. (2) Pyrene addition into the fuel increases pyrene emission. Pyrene emission is mostly brought about by combustion in the cylinder and the formation of pyrene is accelerated by the increase of pyrene content in the fuel. (3) The emissions of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and benzo(ghi)perylene (BghiP), which have relatively high reactivity, decrease with the addition of sulfur to the fuel.This suggests that these PAHs are chemically active and are consumed by chemical reactions on the filter where some fine droplets of sulfuric acid exist.</p>
