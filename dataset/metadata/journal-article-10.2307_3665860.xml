         <abstract>
            <p>An unprecedented surge in financial innovation took place during the 1980s. One of these innovations was the creation of a family of securities designed to lower the cost of preferred stock financing by widening the availability of the dividends-received deduction (a provision of the tax code that allows corporations to avoid paying taxes on a portion of the dividends that they receive from other corporations). Because corporate cash managers are highly risk-averse, the key to the success of this effort was the development of new features that would reduce the price fluctuations of preferred shares so that they could serve as an effective substitute for money market investments. The first-generation product brought to market was adjustable rate preferred stock, a security with a dividend rate that is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in money market yields. Although it was a highly popular product early on, the demand for adjustable rate preferred stock weakened when experience showed that those shares had less price stability than corporate cash managers could tolerate. Adjustable rate preferred shares were too volatile for the simple reason that the dividend couldn't adjust quickly enough to changes in either the general level of interest rates or in the risk profile of the issuing firm. The disappointing experience of adjustable rate preferred shares led to the development of improved dividend adjustment features in a second-generation product, auction rate preferred stock. In addition to resetting the dividend more frequently (usually every 49 days), the refinements to the dividend adjustment procedure for auction rate preferred provide for the dividend yield to be determined in a dutch auction, thereby allowing it to fully adjust to movements in interest rates and to adapt, on a limited basis at least, to changes in the credit risk of the issuing firm. Initial growth of the auction rate preferred stock market was so rapid that the total dollar value of new auction rate issues exceeded the amount of convertible preferred stock and fixed rate preferred issued in 1987. This growth occurred in apparent response to the significant financing advantage to auction rate issues, which typically carry a lower dividend yield than comparable fixed rate shares. In spite of this apparent yield advantage, however, the total dollar amount of auction rate preferred stock outstanding peaked in 1988 and has declined since. We examine the factors influencing issue and redemption activity in the market for auction rate preferred stock, with the objective of explaining why it has atrophied. Evidence of these causal factors provides information on whether auction rate preferred stock is a viable financial innovation that adds value to the corporate balance sheet, or whether it more closely resembles a "speculative balloon" slated for virtual extinction. A linkage between the contraction of the auction rate preferred market and systematic factors such as a reduction in the tax advantage of the security or an indication that the auction process was unreliable would provide reason to question its sustaining innovative features. On the other hand, if the changes in the market are primarily attributable to the replacement of low-quality issues by higher quality shares, recent changes in the market could be viewed as transitory, thereby suggesting that auction rate preferred stock constitutes a legitimate financial innovation that contributes to the completeness of the capital markets. Our approach includes an empirical analysis of the redemption decision along with a summary of the results to a mail survey of 51 companies that have called their auction rate preferred stock for redemption. The design features of auction rate preferred stock suggest an exclusive suitability for transferring capital from fully taxable, risk-averse cash managers to low-risk corporations with low marginal tax rates. Although a steady stream of new, high-quality issues have been underwritten concurrent with redemptions, the market has witnessed a net reduction in size. Our analysis attributes the shrinkage to a confluence of tax and regulatory changes that drastically reduced the number of corporations for whom auction rate preferred would represent an optimal source of capital. From a tax standpoint, a reduction in the dividends-received deduction increased the explicit tax on preferred equity, thereby increasing the pre-tax dividend yield required by corporate purchasers. In conjunction with a simultaneous reduction in the availability of nondebt tax shields, this change increased the cost of preferred equity relative to debt financing. Survey evidence suggests that a portion of the redemptions in our sample can be attributed to these changes. Another apparent catalyst of market atrophication has been a specific set of regulatory changes affecting financial institutions (especially savings and loans) that issued auction rate preferred stock through special purpose subsidiaries. Chief among these changes was the effective elimination of collateralization arrangements that enhanced the appeal of auction rate preferred to the cash management clientele. The importance of credit-enhancement to the sustentation of the market would appear to be critical. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we also conjecture that much of the decline in the market for auction rate preferred stock is due to the fact that the high interest rates that helped to spawn its development have since abated, thereby reducing the rewards from these securities.</p>
