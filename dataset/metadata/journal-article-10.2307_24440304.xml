         <abstract>
            <p>Large firms may issue debt securities to obtain external financing or set up lowly-taxed affiliates for internal debt-shifting purposes. In addition, they may channel interest payments through Dutch special purpose entities (SPEs) to avoid withholding taxes, a widely-used arbitrage strategy. Analysing the capital structure of large EU-based multinationals, this paper provides evidence that the use of Dutch-issuing SPEs is associated with higher debt financing relative to equity. Furthermore, it shows that EU subsidiaries of larger firms are more leveraged and that the use of Dutch on-lending SPEs is also associated with higher subsidiary leverage. Thus, the paper provides evidence that Dutch SPEs facilitate higher external debt financing as well as internal debt shifting. The findings indicate that withholding taxes on interest payments to entities outside the EU, determined by individual EU member states, are not very effective. The national tax systems of EU countries such as the Netherlands, which does not impose interest withholding tax, allow large firms to avoid those taxes.</p>

World Investment Report 2006. The second-largest conduit country for FDI is Luxembourg. At the end of

in addition, from January 1997 to July 2001, firms could apply for the Group Financing Activities
regime. In theory, this special Dutch tax facility could reduce the effective tax rate on net intra-group
interest and royalty income to 7 per cent. See also footnote 6 in Ruf and Weichenrieder (2009). Official
documents and company accounts show that no more than 90 firms were admitted, including at least 27
Dutch multinationals. Smiths Group pic is the only firm in the data set for which there is evidence that it
used the facility. Therefore the special regime is of little significance to the analysis in this paper.</mixed-citation>

For example, according to its annual accounts, the bond-issuing SPE of Energias de Portugal SA had
no staff or office in the Netherlands; its board of directors consisted of two employees of a Dutch service
provider and a Spanish legal person. In 2007, the SPE obtained a tax ruling that specifies its minimum
taxable income as an arm's-length return on equity plus a spread of 0.03 per cent on on-lent funds, minus
operational costs.</mixed-citation>

Source: see footnote 6. This figure excludes securitisations of foreign financial claims issued by
Dutch special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Total non-current debt issued by Dutch SPEs was €312 billion;
on the basis of other data series from the Dutch central bank starting in 2009, I estimate that SPVs
account for 20 to 25 per cent of this total. Of the remaining €250 billion, I estimate that SPEs used some
€225 billion to finance loans to foreign affiliates and €25 billion for other purposes, such as loans to
domestic affiliates.</mixed-citation>

Assuming a moderate taxable income threshold of €1.5 million, corresponding earnings before
interest and taxes of €2.0 million and a profit margin of 10 per cent, the corresponding sales threshold
would be €20 million. However, a firm's future taxable income is uncertain and additional costs may
arise if tax laws are amended or if authorities challenge a tax-planning structure. Therefore in reality the
threshold is probably higher.</mixed-citation>

intra-group financial assets held by intermediate entities. However, as many large firms have intra-group

These are subsidiaries that have one or more subsidiaries themselves. A relatively low threshold of
fixed financial assets is used to include only intermediate-level subsidiaries with substantial operational
activities and to limit double-counting of assets and equity in holding chains. Approximately half of the

observations slightly increases to 2,759.</mixed-citation>
