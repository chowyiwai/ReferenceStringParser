         <abstract>
            <p>These comments on "Use of the CAPM in Public Utility Rate Cases" and the reply to them do not suggest consensus. Utility commission economists Peseau and Zepp endorse the CAPM as a useful tool for discovering risk and establishing allowed return. Carleton argues that the model fits a regulated industry so badly that it can shed no light on the judgment of the cost of equity. Gilster and Linke concern themselves with bias and conclude that the relationship between shifts in a firm's systematic risk and other factors that affect return will determine the direction and extent of bias. Myers demonstrates how the modern portfolio theory reflected in the CAPM can be used in rate cases and warns that the CAPM is not unique in presenting problems in application. Any finance theory must be applied with care. McEnally believes the CAPM should be used with caution; he feels exclusive reliance on it in regulation is a mistake. Sharpe finds flaws in the Brigham-Crum analysis and suggests that a commission can be guided properly by experts who use historic data in estimating beta. Brigham and Crum, in their reply, address the comments and expand on their original paper; they continue to conclude that use of the CAPM will tend to underestimate a utility's cost of capital if for no other reason than because the model ignores nonsystematic risk.</p>
