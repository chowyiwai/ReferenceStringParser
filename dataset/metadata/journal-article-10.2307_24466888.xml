         <abstract>
            <p>We use the 2003 NYSE and NASDAQ listing rules for board and committee independence as a quasinatural experiment to examine the causal relations between board structure and CEO monitoring. Noncompliant firms forced to raise board independence or adopt a fully independent nominating committee significantly increased their forced CEO turnover sensitivity to performance relative to compliant firms. Nominating committee independence is important even when firms had an independent board, and the effect is stronger when the CEO is on the committee. We conclude that greater board independence and full independence of nominating committees lead to more rigorous CEO monitoring and discipline.</p>

According to the NYSE's new exchange listing requirements, the nominating committee must, at a minimum, be
responsible for identifing individuals qualified to become board members, selecting, or recommending that the
board select the director nominees for the next annual meeting of shareholders, and developing and recommending
to the board a set of corporate goverance guidelines applicable to the corporation and overseeing the evaluation
of the board and management.</mixed-citation>

According to Berle and Means (1932, 87): "... control will tend to be in the hands of those who select the
proxy committee and by whom, the election of directors for the ensuing period will be made. Since the proxy
committee is appointed by existing management, they can virtually dictate their own successors."</mixed-citation>

Core, Holthausen, and Larcker (1999) find that CEO compensation is higher when the CEO is involved in the

These exchange listing rules also require non-management directors to hold regular meetings that exclude
management. NASDAQ allows a majority of independent directors to nominate directors or set CEO
compensation if a firm lacks a nominating or compensation committee. "Controlled" firms, in which an individual,
group, or another firm holds a majority of voting rights, are exempt from the independent board, nominating,
and compensation committee requirements.</mixed-citation>

The official name of Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection
Act, whose objective is to ensure the accuracy and credibility of corporate financial reports. With two exceptions,
the provisions of SOX affect almost all U.S. public firms and compliance was required by the 2003 year-end
(which precedes the compliance dates of the exchange listing requirements, occurring in 2004 and 2005). The
first exception is Section 301, which required all public firms to have a fully independence audit committee.
This is the only board structure requirement in SOX that was implemented in the new exchange listing rules
we study. The second exception is Section 404. Section 404 (a) required companies to include an assessment
of internal control for financial reporting (ICFR) in their annual reports, and Section 404(b) required companies
to provide an independent auditor's attestation. For smaller public companies, defined as those with a public
float below $75 million, compliance with Section 404(a) was postponed until after December 15, 2007, while
the implementation of Section 404(b) was initially postponed for these firms and later became an exemption
under the Dodd-Frank Act. We find that our noncompliant samples are not dominated by these smaller public
companies. In fact, the mean market capitalization of firms noncompliant in 2001 with any of the four rules is
above $6 billion.</mixed-citation>

As noted by Hermalin and Weisbach (1998), the same prediction can be generated by assuming independent
directors attribute less value to retaining the incumbent CEO than do non-independent directors because of their
reputation concerns, better alignment with shareholder interests, or lack of other ties to the CEO.</mixed-citation>

Chhaochharia and Grinstein (2009) exploit the same natural experiment to study the effect of board independence
on CEO compensation. Guthrie, Sokolowsky, and Wan (2010) revisit these results and find that board
independence has no effect on CEO total pay, while firms forced to adopt an independent compensation committee
raise CEO total pay. While higher CEO pay can indicate weaker monitoring, it can also reflect more intensive
monitoring. For example, in Hermalin (2005), a rise in board monitoring reduces CEO job stability, which
requires higher pay to compensate for higher CEO risk bearing. In robustness analysis, we found that controlling
for CEO pay-for-performance sensitivity leaves our major findings unchanged.</mixed-citation>

Dahya, McConnell, and Travlos (2002) note that compliance with the Cadbury Code is not totally voluntary
because London Stock Exchange requires listed companies to "comply or explain." However, to the extent that
some firms did choose not to adhere to the Code, their interpretation of the results is still contaminated by
endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, it is unclear whether their evidence is applicable to firms in other countries
that differ in terms of board powers and other governance mechanisms.</mixed-citation>
