There are indications that the cross-elasticities between services even with non-proximate departure times are
likely to be quite high. About 50 per cent of journeys by InterCity are for purposes of personal business, visiting
friends and relatives or for holidays, and thus are likely to be associated with flexible times of departure and arrival.
Significantly, there is evidence of a willingness of many of those travelling on Saver tickets to transfer the day of
travel in response to fare differentials. Market research in the mid-1980s suggested that roughly 12 per cent of those
travelling on a low Saver day would have preferred to have travelled on a high Saver day but were deterred from
doing so by the fare differential (of about 20 per cent). This suggests that existing service frequencies are likely to
provide a good basis for dividing the timetable into rival packages which offer effective competition.</mixed-citation>

The White Paper did not specify how the established system of timetabling and gaining access to spare track
capacity migh change with privatisation; it did, however, note that 'the timetabling process is of key importance
in deciding which services should have priority in the allocation of paths' (para. 59). The responsibility for
timetabling in the new regime will fall to Railtrack which will own track and other infrastructure and control the
day-to-day operations. The Regulator will also have an oversight of the arrangements for track access and a
responsibility for promoting competition.</mixed-citation>

The system of tradeable property rights operates at certain US airports where airlines buy and sell landing slots.
However, in the US case, the rights to slots being operated on a specified date were given initially to the incumbent
airlines. Thus, the established airlines enjoyed a lump sum financial benefit. In contrast, we propose here that the
initial 'packages' are subject to bids.</mixed-citation>

In-service competition may also change incentives to provide efficient train performance standards and if
performance does deteriorate (more breakdowns, poorer time keeping, etc.), external costs will clearly occur as a
consequence of the shared network. However, the theoretical literature does not give clear and unequivocal guidance
as to whether performance will improve or deteriorate with increased competition (Rovizzi and Thompson, 1992).</mixed-citation>
