         <abstract xml:lang="eng">
            <p>The Lotte World Tower became the world’s fifth-tallest building upon completion in 2017, and is currently the only supertall building (300 meters or higher) in Seoul. As it is located a fair distance from other tall buildings, the project’s designers bore substantial responsibility to not only create an enduring skyline icon, but also to provide a culturally relevant and well-integrated project within the urban grain. Beyond the spectacle of its sleek design and great height, the tower is part of a mixed-use complex that has provided additional public amenities. With its diverse program, it is hoped the project will become a beloved destination in Seoul.</p>
