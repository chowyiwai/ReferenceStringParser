         <abstract>
            <p>I consider the Turkish banking industry, which is dominated by a few large banks, and taking up a conjectural variation approach, I estimate a structural model to examine the market conduct of the largest banks for the period 1988–2009. The estimation results suggest that Turkish banks colluded in the loan market during the sample period. This evidence demonstrates that there is a conflict between market concentration and competition in the Turkish banking industry. Thus, in order to protect competition, regulatory agencies should be cautious of efforts that may increase concentration in the banking industry.</p>

The empirical literature on the measurement of competition can be divided into two ma-
jor streams: structural (the SCP paradigm) and nonstructural (the Panzar-Rosse model and the
Bresnahan model) approaches. The SCP paradigm argues that higher concentration in the banking
market causes less competitive bank conduct and leads to higher bank profitability (see Berger et
al. 2004 for a critical review). Due to the theoretical and empirical deficiencies of this approach,
nonstructural methods have been developed. The Panzar-Rosse model presents a reduced form ap-
proach to discriminate between perfect competition, monopolistic competition, and monopoly. A test
statistic (the H-statistic), corresponding to the sum of elasticities of bank revenues with respect to
factor-input prices, serves as a measure of market competition (for a broad review, see Bikker and
Haaf 2002). The Bresnahan model estimates an unknown parameter (known as conjectural varia-
tion parameter), which is derived through first-order conditions of profit maximization of firms in
an oligopolistic market. The unknown parameter is based on the idea that when a bank chooses its
price (or output), the bank takes into account the reaction of competitors. While avoiding making
indirect inferences about market power based on indicators of concentration is a major advantage,
these nonstructural approaches require detailed information about cost and demand conditions.</mixed-citation>
