         <abstract>
            <p>The schedular system of income tax in the UK frequently comes under attack, not least in relation to the distinctions it draws between the tax treatment of the employed and the self-employed. However, on examination, it appears that non-schedular systems of taxation share both these distinctions and the difficulties that arise from them, albeit to varying degrees. The division between employed and self-employed is also problematic for social security systems. These difficulties are found, to a greater or lesser extent, in all the jurisdictions studied by the authors. It may be argued that all or some of the tax and social security differences are justified by fundamental economic and legal differences between the nature of employment and self-employment relationships. This may be true where the relationships compared are unambiguously, on the one hand, employment and, on the other, self-employment. However, there have always been non-standard relationships that combine characteristics of both these broad categories. This grey area appears to be increasing with changing work patterns. Consequently, the simple dichotomous system adopted by the UK tax and social security systems has come under pressure. This article considers the problems arising from this situation and some of the ideas that have been put forward to deal with them.</p>

For example, the informal annual voluntary settlement procedure under which employers settled tax on some
employees' fringe benefits and expenses by a single annual payment has now been formalised by the Income
Tax (Employments) (Amendment No. 6) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2631). Items covered by a PAYE
settlement agreement will not need to be included in the returns of the employee or employer.</mixed-citation>

In practice, this rule does not seem to have a more relaxed effect than the Schedule D rule, despite the decision
in Sargent v. Barnes (1978) 2 All ER: see Macdonald (1978). Changes proposed in the 1996 Budget also relax
the travel expenses rules for certain employees and could put them at an advantage over the self-employed in
some circumstances (Budget Press Release, November 1996, REV 5).</mixed-citation>

Other difficulties are that maintenance of the contributory doctrine makes it difficult to accept the use of
concessions for National Insurance purposes in cases where they would be applied by the Inland Revenue, and
that taxation is levied annually, whether under cumulative PAYE or self-assessment, whilst National Insurance
is non-cumulative so that it is necessary to deduct the right amount on an ongoing basis — Department of

Technically, SERPS could be made available to the self-employed but the complexity and cost of the scheme
make its extension highly unlikely. Recent discussion has tended to focus, rather, on abolition of SERPS and
its replacement by compulsory private funded pensions, although that would also present many difficulties:
