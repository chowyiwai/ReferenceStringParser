         <abstract>
            <p>The author states that the problems of inland waterway transportation are more a matter of public education than anything else and that, given the water-way on which suitable boats can be navigated, the problems of the vessels themselves and their methods of propulsion are by no means difficult. Referring to the New York State Barge Canal, the thought passes to the problem of motive power for canal barges. The author believes the internal-combustion engine in some form will be found eventually to be the most desirable, although at present little thought is being given to any power other than steam; the author discusses what form of this type of engine would be most suitable. Canal-barge engine requirements are considered at some length and the necessity of positive engine reversibility is emphasized, the conditions affecting this being outlined. The amount of power necessary for a canal barge is discussed, the governing factors being outlined. Shippers, barge builders, engine builders and their associated industries are urged to work out the problem of water transportation.</p>
