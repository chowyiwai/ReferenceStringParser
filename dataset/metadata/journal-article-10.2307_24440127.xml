         <abstract>
            <p>It has traditionally been believed that collecting survey measures of total spending necessarily involved asking a large number of questions, too many for inclusion of a comprehensive spending measure in a general-purpose survey. In this paper, we report on a supplemental survey to the Health and Retirement Study that took up this challenge. We discuss issues that arise when designing a survey module to collect spending data with strict time constraints, describe how the implementation in the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS) played out, and elicit anomalies that more detailed analysis of data quality revealed. We report how we addressed some of these anomalies in subsequent waves of CAMS. Other anomalies required conducting some randomised experiments to find what explains the observed patterns. The results highlight the tension between asking about spending using a long time frame, which exacerbates recall bias, versus using a short time frame, which risks relying on an unrepresentative snapshot of a household's spending to proxy the total for the last 12 months. An important complicating factor in deciding which goods should be put into which time frames is that there is substantial heterogeneity in the frequency of spending across households even for the same category of spending.</p>

Economic theory models consumption, not spending. However, it is spending that is measured in
household surveys. This difference is not a matter of great concern provided we have good methods of
finding the flow of consumption services from consumer durables. Thus in surveys of household
consumption such as the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), no distinction is made between
consumption and spending. That is the point of view in this paper and we will use consumption and
spending interchangeably.</mixed-citation>

The 'age' of the CEX household is the age of the reference person, who is the owner or renter of the
dwelling. Thus, an 80-year-old living with her 54-year-old son in his house would be classified as aged 54
in the CEX. In the HRS, each person is a sample member, so we can study consumption by the household
in which the 80-year-old lives. For classification by age, we assign in the HRS the age of the husband to
be the age of the household, to make the comparison as relevant as possible with the CEX. The HRS does
not elicit ownership of assets, so we cannot match the CEX classification exactly.</mixed-citation>
