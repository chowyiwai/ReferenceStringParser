         <abstract>
            <p>Prices of real and financial assets fell substantially in the UK during 2008–09. The fourth wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) was in the field throughout this 'financial crisis'. We use these data, and earlier ELSA waves, to document the effect of the crisis on those aged 50 and over in England, importantly taking into account that a significant proportion of the wealth of these households is held in forms such as state pensions that will not be directly affected by movements in asset prices. We find that the median fall in wealth among individuals was 8 per cent of total household gross wealth with, on average, richer individuals having experienced a larger decline. We find some evidence that those who experienced greater wealth shocks were more likely to reduce their expected chance of leaving a large bequest and to reduce their spending on certain 'semi-luxury' items such as clothing and food consumed out of the home.</p>

This research was made possible by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant number
RES 000-224-323 and the IFS Retirement Saving Consortium which comprises Age UK, Association of
British Insurers, Department for Work and Pensions, Financial Services Authority, HM Treasury,
Investment Management Association, Money Advice Service, National Association of Pension Funds,
Partnership Pensions and the Pensions Corporation. Cofunding was also received from the ESRC-funded
Centre for Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP, reference RES-544-28-0001) at the Institute
for Fiscal Studies. The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) data are made available through
the UK Data Archive (UKDA). ELSA was developed by a team of researchers based at the National
Centre for Social Research, University College London and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The data were
collected by the National Centre for Social Research. The funding is provided by the National Institute of
Aging in the United States, and a consortium of UK government departments coordinated by the Office
for National Statistics. The developers and funders of ELSA and UKDA do not bear any responsibility for
