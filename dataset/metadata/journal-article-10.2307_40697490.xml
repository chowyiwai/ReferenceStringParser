         <abstract>
            <p>Samuel Paul Garner spent nearly seven decades, as a student, professor, administrator, leader and visionary, enhancing the understanding and development of our academic community. Born in 1910, he studied at Duke University, then briefly as a non degree student at Columbia before teaching and then entering the Ph. D. program at the University of Texas at Austin. At Texas, under the direction of George Hillis Newlove, he focused upon accounting. His interest in history had been kindled by a noted economic historian Earl J. Hamilton, under whom Garner had studied at Duke. His first post doctoral appointment would be his lifelong assignment, as a member of the faculty of what is now the Culverhouse School of Accountancy at the University of Alabama. Starting in 1939 he served as a faculty member, next as department chair, and then for seventeen years, from 1954 to 1971, as dean of the College of Business. His career achievements are many and include being the only person to serve as President of both the American Accounting Association [1951] and the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business [1964-65]. His post-retirement activities identified with the quarter century from 1971 through 1996 permitted members of subsequent generations to benefit from his knowledge and counsel. Garner's work as a scholar, a historian, an institutional developer and a visionaryâ€” especially in the area of international relations, are told in this paper. A special appendix, which contains the last known curriculum vita prepared by Garner, is also provided.</p>
