It is likely that by the end of the century, water companies may have run up around £8.5 billion to £12 billion of
debt. These approximate figures were based on the assumptions of 50-75 per cent gearing ratios and an investment

The problem of commitment in a dynamic regulatory framework was considered by Baron and Besanko (1987)
when they modelled the behaviour of a regulator and firm in the absence of complete information. In a dynamic
framework, the regulator is able to observe firm behaviour as time progresses which reveals information about
costs and, consequently, there is an incentive for the regulator to change policy.</mixed-citation>
