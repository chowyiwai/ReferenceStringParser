         <p> Cyber Security - Essential principles to secure your organisation takes you through the fundamentals of cyber security, the principles that underpin it, vulnerabilities and threats, and how to defend against attacks. Organisations large and small experience attacks every day, from simple phishing emails to intricate, detailed operations masterminded by criminal gangs, and for every vulnerability fixed, another pops up, ripe for exploitation. Cyber security doesn't have to cost vast amounts of money or take a short ice age to implement. No matter the size of your organisation, improving cyber security helps protect your data and that of your clients, improving business relations and opening the door to new opportunities. This pocket guide will take you through the essentials of cyber security - the principles that underpin it, vulnerabilities and threats and the attackers who use them, and how to defend against them - so you can confidently develop a cyber security programme. Cyber Security - Essential principles to secure your organisation: Covers the key differences between cyber and information security; Explains how cyber security is increasingly mandatory and how this ties into data protection, e.g. the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation); Focuses on the nature of the problem, looking at technical, physical and human threats and vulnerabilities; Explores the importance of security by design; Gives guidance on why security should be balanced and centralised; and Introduces the concept of using standards and frameworks to manage cyber security. No matter the size of your organisation, cyber security is no longer optional - it is an essential component of business success and a critical defence against the risks of the information age. The only questions left are to decide when and where your journey will begin. Start that journey now - buy this book today!</p>

                     <p>The terms ‘information security’ and ‘cyber security’ are often used interchangeably, when in fact they refer to different (albeit related) things.</p>
                     <p>Information security is concerned with ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability (C, I and A) of all information held by an organisation, irrespective of whether the information is electronic or in hard-copy format. As a result, information security generally involves considering physical and environmental controls alongside technological ones (lockable filing cabinets, key-code doors, etc.).</p>
                     <p>Cyber security is a subset of information security and is concerned with the same things, but where information security takes a generalist approach, cyber security</p>

                     <p>Risk is an inevitable part of life. Every time you do something in which the outcome is uncertain, you take a risk, whether it’s something simple like crossing the road, or something complex like undergoing surgery. Risk is a function of uncertainty – without uncertainty, there is no risk.</p>
                     <p>Different business fields approach risk in different ways, but the general principles remain the same: the likelihood of an adverse event is mapped against the effect that event would have were it to occur. If the outcome is severe and the likelihood high enough, then it is sensible to take steps to</p>

                     <p>For a product (whether software or hardware) to be secure, it must be developed with security in mind from the outset. This was a challenge in the days when most development still used the ‘waterfall’ model; in the era of Agile and similar, more iterative methodologies, the challenge has never been greater.</p>
                     <p>Secure development is not a new concept. The rapid spread of computers and the Internet in the late 1990s highlighted the myriad security flaws and issues in the era’s operating systems, software and hardware. Viruses and worms proliferated, and customers demanded action. At Microsoft, Bill Gates’s famous 2002</p>

                     <p>Some of the biggest threats to cyber security come not from technology, but from the people who use it. According to a 2019 report by Verizon, 34% of security incidents (out of 41,686 analysed) were attributable to internal actors. 14 Most insider threats are not actively or deliberately malicious. In fact, most of the time, cyber incidents that are traced to insiders are simple mistakes that anyone could make, like being tricked by a cloned email. A 2018 report by Ponemon Institute that surveyed more than 3,000 insider incidents attributed only 23% of them to criminal and malicious insiders. 15</p>

                     <p>Physical threats are an often-neglected aspect of cyber security, yet they can affect organisations every bit as much as technological threats. Cyber security must incorporate physical security to be truly effective – it’s no good protecting sensitive data with an array of technological controls if someone can simply walk into the building and take it.</p>
                     <p>Physical security begins with identifying your perimeter and securing it, which means locks on doors and entry points to sensitive areas, like server rooms. Many organisations use keycard or PIN-entry locks to secure sensitive areas, but these carry their own risks. Staff may write down PINs</p>

                     <p>An increasingly interconnected world requires increasingly interconnected organisations. No matter the field your organisation operates in, there’s a good chance your products or services rely on components, or even whole products produced by third parties. No doubt you also share data – via email, perhaps, or through a dedicated vendor portal. This connectivity brings great benefits, but it also exposes you to risk. You can control those risks as they relate to your organisation, but your supplier’s control measures are a different story altogether. The modern supply chain stretches across the globe and encompasses thousands of organisations. More data is shared</p>

Large organisations are just as vulnerable as smaller organisations to zero-day vulnerabilities and attacks that take advantage of human nature – this is a big part of why large organisations with significant cyber security budgets still suffer major data breaches that hit the headlines.</p>

As your cyber security posture evolves, however, you may find that standards or frameworks can benefit your organisation in several ways.</p>
                     <p>Standards and frameworks offer a tried, tested and comprehensive approach to cyber security developed by experts in the field. Adopting such an approach takes some of the guesswork out of developing or improving your own system, enhancing your defences in line with recognised industry best practice</p>
