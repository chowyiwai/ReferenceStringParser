         <abstract>
            <p>The paper analyses the hypothesis that economic performance of a banking system is a function of its market structure, policy and demand variables with particular reference to the Nigerian banking system. Economic performance here refers to the profit and profitability performance of the banks. Although there are other objectives that bank management may pursue, profitability performance goal stands out head and shoulder above the other if the bank is to be viable in the long-run. The paper therefore identified and discussed the following factors as the determinants of bank profitability performance: i. Market structure variables which comprise total assets, deposit concentration ratio and number of bank offices ii. Policy variables which include time plus savings deposits to total deposit ratio, loans and advances to total deposits ratio iii. Demand variables which is proxied here by per capita income. The study reveals that market structure as measured by the number of bank offices matters for bank profitability performance in Nigeria. This notwithstanding, however, on the balance, the impact of market structure on the profitability performance of the Nigerian banking system is not strong. The policy and demand factors are found to be important determinants of profit ability performance of the Nigerian banking system. These findings have implications for the banks as well as for the regulatory authorities. For the banks, there is the need to minimize their total resource cost by a clever combination of cost-effective source of deposits. This is very important because expense control is the most important factor in achieving high bank profits. The regulatory authorities, on the other hand, should continue with the policy of expansion of bank offices as long as it leads to greater incremental revenue to the banks than incremental expenses. Furthermore, regulatory emphasis should be more on policy factors. The monetary authorities should, to a great extent, release their firm control on interest rates structure.</p>
