            <p>THE introduction of the high-speed, low-weightper-horsepower diesel engine Drought the realization that such equipment might be rather sensitive to changes in fuel properties. Observations of automotive diesel equipment in service showed that lubricant characteristics could not in themselves account for the differences in the observed fouling and wear. These reports led the authors to initiate a series of tests designed to study the problem specifically and in more detail. From these studies, it became clear that the selection of suitable fuels is an important factor in the control of fouling and wear in automotive diesel engines. Assumirig stability, freedom from water and soaps, and absence of corrosive abrasive, and residual materials, the major diesel fuel characteristics governing automotive diesel-engine fouling and wear are sulfur content, ignition quality, viscosity, and/or volatility. Of these properties, sulfur content is the most important. Increasing the sulfur content from 0.2% to 1.0% may result in a 40 to 80% increased engine fouling and a two to sixfold increase in ring and cylinder wear. Using detergent types of lubricants will only partially alleviate the fouling and wear due to the fuel. The influence of these fuel properties, as determined by the authors, particularly the influence of sulfur on fouling and wear, apparently cannot be applied directly to larger slow-speed diesels in marine and industrial service.</p>
