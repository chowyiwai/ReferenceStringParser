Of course the above discussion has not considered the provision for carrying forw ard losses and the
influence of losses on taxable marginal returns. But since the timing of tax liabilities affects present
values, as the second section demonstrates, the inter-relationship proposition is still in general
applicable to a multiperiod context.</mixed-citation>

This can be readily derived from the valuation of the firm at time t:

There has been some discussion in the literature about whether costs of capital or internal rates of
return are the appropriate criteria by which to assess neutrality (see, for example, Auerbach (1982),
Boadway (1978) and Kay (1972)).

There are two assumptions that can be made about losses carried forward and ACT which are still
unrelieved at the end of the period. At one extreme it could be assumed that they are never claimed
because earnings never become sufficient (and this is the assumption implicit in table 2); at the other
extreme the present values could be computed on the assumption that they are claimed in the
following period. In fact the results in table 2 are not drastically altered if the alternative assumption is
employed. For the sake of comparison we show the results for line (i) of table 2 assuming full
realization of losses and unrelieved ACT outstanding at the end of the period:
