         <abstract>
            <p>This paper uses the Millennium Cohort Study to look at ethnic differences in birth outcomes for a cohort of English children born in 2000 and 2001. There is an increasingly large literature showing that longer gestation and higher birthweight are positively associated with cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes later in life, so understanding sources of ethnic differences in these outcomes and identifying factors that may influence birth outcomes has a lot of potential policy interest. This paper shows that even after controlling for background characteristics in a number of ways, there still remain unexplained differences in both gestation and birthweight outcomes across broad ethnic groups. It also suggests, however, that there may be potential policy levers that could be used to narrow this ethnic gap in birth outcomes, such as reducing the proportion of underweight Asian mothers and overweight Black mothers and increasing ethnic minority attendance at antenatal classes.</p>

In earlier work, we also looked at sources of ethnic inequality in child outcomes at 9 months. It turns
out that two of the most important determinants of all parent-assessed outcomes at 9 months are
gestational age at delivery and birthweight. Because of this, we thought that it was important to
document in detail ethnic differences in these two outcomes as a starting point for our research in this
area.</mixed-citation>

The body mass index is measured as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in metres. It is
used in this paper to classify people as underweight (BMI less than 18.5), normal (BMI in the range 18.5
to 24.9), overweight (BMI in the range 25 to 29.9) and obese (BMI 30 and above).</mixed-citation>
