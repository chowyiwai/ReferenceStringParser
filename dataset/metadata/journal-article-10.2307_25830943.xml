         <abstract>
            <p>In India, cooperatives in the housing sector have been playing an integral role in the supply of financial services. Despite being a third major player, cooperatives have yet to fully realise their goals of catering to the needs of their members. Since, only one-third of their members have obtained housing benefits through these organisations, and the cooperatives need to go a very long way to meet the total needs of their members. Towards that direction, cooperatives have to abandon their present indolent attitude and rejuvenate themselves to justify their presence, in the days to come. This paper highlights the poor organizational inter-linkage, the weak financial base, dissuasion of working funds, poor coverage of members for housing benefits, growing financial indiscipline and the organizational balance sheet. Given the changing circumstances in India's' housing sector, rejuvenation of cooperatives both from their internal and external points of view has been considered.</p>
