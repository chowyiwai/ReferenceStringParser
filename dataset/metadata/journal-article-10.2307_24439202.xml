         <abstract>
            <p>This paper tests the published section-level price and weight data used in the compilation of the UK retail price index (RPI) for consistency with the theory of the cost-of-living index. We use a non-parametric test of theoretical consistency and bootstrap statistical methods to estimate the probability of consistency.</p>

il is important to note that the standard model of consumers' behaviour is not designed for its literal,
descriptive properties but for its analytical properties. It is not necessary to believe that consumers actually do
the following, just that their behaviour is consistent with it.</mixed-citation>

The term 'rational' is used here in a technical sense idiosyncratic to Economics. If preferences are rational in
this sense, then it means that they satisfy certain regularity conditions/assumptions: completeness, reflexivity,
transitivity and continuity. Conversely, if a consumer's preferences conform to these regularity conditions, then
they can be represented by a utility function. See Varian (1978, pp. 111-13).</mixed-citation>

A utility function is a handy technical device, nothing more. It should not be given any psychological
interpretation. The particular utility number it produces from a given bundle of goods is not significant. The
only relevant feature is its ordinal character. Thus if f/(q) represents some preferences and / : SR —» 9? is
strictly increasing, then /((/(q)) represents exactly the same preferences as C/(q) since /( f/(q)) &gt; /(b'(q')) if and
only if C/(q) &gt; U(q').</mixed-citation>

(1973) also provided a proof which omits condition (3). Varian (1982) provides a proof which exchanges

For example, there was a single combined section index and weight published for poultry and other meat until
1987, when they were split. To obtain consistent data, we have had to recombine the separate sections after
1987. We do this using the RPI methodology for aggregating section indices. See Baxter ( 1998, pp. 68-70).</mixed-citation>

Baxter, 1998, p. 39. Whilst the FES is one of the primary sources of data for the section weights for the RPI,
note that some section weights are calculated from three years of FES data, and others are calculated from
alternative sources when the FES is thought to underestimate expenditure on the relevant commodities. Other
weights, such as those for council tax, mortgage interest payments and depreciation, are calculated using
models (Baxter, 1998). For these reasons, the quantities that correspond to the published weights are not the
same as those that we would recover directly from the FES section expenditures. As a result, because we are
interested in testing the published data, we do not use the FES to estimate individual section weights but only
total expenditure. See the discussion below.</mixed-citation>

We have organised the FES into commodity groups corresponding to our RPI section weight data from 1975
to 1999. The first set of weights we have that overlap with these FES data are those for 1977, which refer to the
July 1975 to June 1976 base period; the last are the weights for 2000, which correspond to the base period July
1998 to June 1999.</mixed-citation>

We are grateful to the suggestion from a referee that we also consider restricting the test to non-durable
commodities (the existence of durables being a prima facie reason for perhaps stepping away from the
intertemporally separable, static version of the theory which we are testing). Doing this makes passing GARP
more likely on these data, giving P(GARP-non-durables) = 0.918.</mixed-citation>

Given the need to publish the index in a timely manner, the use of certain, otherwise rather desirable,
formulae, such as the Törnqvist index or Fisher's index, might be impractical, at least without some mechanism
for publishing revisions to the index. However, others, such as those based on budget-share-weighted geometric
means of period-to-period price ratios (i.e. those that are exact for Cobb-Douglas utility), would be practicable.</mixed-citation>
