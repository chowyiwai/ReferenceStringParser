         <abstract>
            <p>While a number of important attempts have been made to describe characteristics of an intersection purely in mathematical terms, the most fruitful research from a practical standpoint has utilized simulation. This paper reports the results of research in which a fourway stop intersection was simulated on a digital computer. Inputs to the program were based on field studies at three intersections in metropolitan Atlanta using mathematical models and Monte Carlo techniques. Field data were taken with the aid of a spring wound Esterline-Angus 20-pen event recorder and time lapse movies. The simulation model was used to study the effectiveness of the four-way stop at various approach volumes and turning movement combinations. Results of experiments conducted on the simulation model are given by graphs showing the relationship between traffic volumes and average delay, per cent delayed, and average queue length.</p>
