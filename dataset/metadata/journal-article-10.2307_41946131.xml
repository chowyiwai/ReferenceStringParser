         <abstract>
            <p>It has been estimated that the earthquake that struck Los Angeles in January 1994 cost Property-Casualty (P&amp;C) insurers $9 billion in covered loss claims. However, in 1989, San Francisco experienced a severe earthquake that impacted exposed property-casualty firms positively. This reaction has become known as "gaining from loss" in that investor expectations of higher demand for insurance and higher premiums may have more than offset the potential losses due to the earthquake. This study considers the "gaining from loss" proposition by examining the P&amp;C reaction around the recent Los Angeles earthquake. Although this natural catastrophe generated substantially more damage than the San Francisco earthquake, and exhibited very different demographic characteristics, the market did not penalize insurers. Rather, significant positive returns are associated with exposed insurers around the Los Angeles earthquake. "Gaining from loss" holds.</p>
