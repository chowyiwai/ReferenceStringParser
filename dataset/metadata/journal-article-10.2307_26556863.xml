         <abstract xml:lang="eng">
            <p>The article is an analysis of Private Equity investment deal values across 24 industries by select Private Equity funds from 2007–2016. The purpose of the research is to identify any patterns of movement of deal values. The study established the growth rate of deal values and observed the performance of each Private Equity fund throughout the 10-year period. The purpose of the study is to determine the significance of Private Equity investment for the promotion, growth, and development of industries. In the case of heavy industries such as Energy, Engineering and Construction and Manufacturing, Private Equity investment becomes inevitable, at least as a supplement to government funding. Due to rising disposable income and purchasing power of people, industries such as BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) Retail, and other services such as Travel, Transport, and Telecom are also attracting considerable Private Equity. The role of Private Equity as an indispensable tool for industrialization is emerging and becoming dynamic. Furthermore, the government's go-ahead attitude towards reforms is further boosting Private Equity investment's opportunities and impact on India's economic development.</p>
