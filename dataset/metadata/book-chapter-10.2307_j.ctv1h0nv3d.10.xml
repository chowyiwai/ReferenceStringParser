      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Artificial Intelligence is a seemingly neutral technology, but it is increasingly used to manage workforces and make decisions to hire and fire employees. Its proliferation in the workplace gives the impression of a fairer, more efficient system of management. A machine can't discriminate, after all. Augmented Exploitation explores the reality of the impact of AI on workers' lives. While the consensus is that AI is a completely new way of managing a workplace, the authors show that, on the contrary, AI is used as most technologies are used under capitalism: as a smokescreen that hides the deep exploitation of workers. Going beyond platform work and the gig economy, the authors explore emerging forms of algorithmic governance and AI-augmented apps that have been developed to utilise innovative ways to collect data about workers and consumers, as well as to keep wages and worker representation under control. They also show that workers are not taking this lying down, providing case studies of new and exciting form of resistance that are springing up across the globe.</p>

                     <p>Technology has shaped and reshaped work in various ways throughout history. Digital technology is continuing to create widespread change across different kinds of work, a process that is set to intensify with the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. So far, there has been documented use of AI in the hiring, managing and firing of workers. Less understood are the effects of this on the labour process, workers and managers more broadly. Although platform work uses AI extensively to plan, manage and control workers, there is limited empirical research on how these processes operate in practice.</p>

                     <p>Most scholarly and governmental discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) today focus on a country’s technological competitiveness and try to identify how this supposedly new technological capability will improve productivity. Some discussions look at AI ethics. But AI is more than a technological advancement. It is a social question and requires philosophical inquiry. From the time of the Victorians who built tiny machines resembling maids, to the development of humanoid carebots such as are seen in Japan today, we have been reifying machines with our characteristics. Malabou (2015) discusses the cyberneticians’ assumptions that intelligence is primarily associated with reason as per</p>

                     <p>Actors promoting artificial intelligence preach a one-directional technological evolution. They argue that societies on the cutting edge of digital innovation should follow a process of systemic change from data-dependent services to data-fed, autonomous and intelligent systems. The field of current and future AI application ranges from web search, news filtering, credit scoring and banking services, facial recognition, machine learning microchips, network optimisation and autonomous vehicles, to advanced healthcare biometrics, drug discovery, welfare benefits and other government assessment, cyber-threat hunting, anti-counterfeiting, music mastering and crop monitoring.

                     <p>Algorithms are consciously constructed and implemented in the capitalist labour process to discipline and control labour. They are embedded in the use of rating tools, on-by-data extraction and tracking technologies, all of it fostering managerial surveillance and thereby facilitating labour extraction (Gandini 2018; Srnicek 2017; Woodcock 2020). It is argued that this quantification of labour in algorithmic workplaces leads to higher alienation among workers (Moore 2018). So, one might argue that the use of algorithms could facilitate ‘breaking’ these subordinated groups, as workers face the blank logic of the capitalist labour process. But what if it does not always work</p>

                     <p>By collecting and connecting huge amounts of data, people analytics not only promises to raise the effectiveness of people management practices (Manuti and de Palma 2018; Goodell King 2016; Sullivan 2013) but to establish new possibilities to evaluate and control staff. From the perspective of ‘knowledge capitalism’, people analytics is but one relevant field in which actors strive ‘to make the intangible assets employees ... embody computable and calculable’ (Vormbusch 2007: 92) – an intimately linked one is the invention of ‘taxonomies of the self ’ (Moore and Robinson 2016; Vormbusch 2020). Consequently, in his analysis of the legal implications</p>

                     <p>Why do workers work as hard as they do? Following the work of Burawoy (1979), labour sociologists have extensively studied this question with regard to employment relationships. It is now widely acknowledged that a labour contract does not in itself suffice to enrol workers into an enterprise. Sophisticated management schemes have to be implemented in order to secure the workers’ consent, most often by creating what Burawoy called an ‘illusion of choice’. It is thus with great effort that managers channel the workers’ force into value creation. The recent digitisation of work allows businesses to flourish by securing the consent</p>

                     <p>The question about the relationship between technological change and labour autonomy is a constant in the sociology of work and the object of a large number of empirical studies. The answers to that question vary to a great extent, from authors emphasising the technological potential for labour’s empowerment, work relief, up- and multi-skilling, to others concerned about increased labour control, deskilling and job destruction. The ongoing digitalisation of work has recently revived this debate, with a current tendency to assess the impact of digitalisation on labour autonomy in terms of its consequences for workers’ scope of action.</p>

                     <p>An extensive transformation of financial intermediation services has been seen in recent years. Concepts such as digital platforms, business intelligence, mobile apps, digital banking or virtual office have been increasingly implemented within the Chilean banking sector. For supporters of technological change, this is about a local adaptation to the global financial market, greater possibilities for innovation, and the creation of skilled jobs. On the other hand, opponents depict this scenario as creating a massive extinction of job positions, less social security and more labour uncertainty. Beyond these perspectives, however, it is an undeniable fact that the banking labour process is</p>

The industry’s heyday predates the ubiquity of the fax machine, scanning technologies and ultimately email as the only fast and reliable method of transporting documents and packages across urban space. This speed was afforded by removing the central ‘distribution centre’ – required for national delivery networks such as the Royal Mail and FedEx – instead favouring</p>

Specifically, we are interested in whether there is something potentially emancipatory in these individualised and individualising routines and practices of self-quantification. Can workplace AI, algorithmic measurement and control and other tools for self-quantification be repurposed and wielded in support of collective resistance?</p>

                     <p>The labour process on digital platforms, especially in the food-delivery sector, has been the subject of much research. Most studies agree that in this context a new regime of tight algorithmic control is emerging (Ivanova et al. 2018; Wood et al. 2019). Many of these studies emphasise the tendency of AI and algorithmic control to atomise workers and thus make collective resistance unlikely (e.g. Mahnkopf 2020; Veen, Barratt and Goods 2019). Shoshana Zuboff (2019) states that the ubiquity of digital sensor technology has finally eliminated all zones of uncertainty from the labour process by total surveillance. However, other studies claim</p>

                     <p>In December 2018 a group of over 30 food-delivery couriers, activists and researchers gathered in Berlin to discuss the new payment system implemented by Deliveroo. Instead of paying the same fee for each delivery, the company would price each order differently based on the distance between the restaurant and the customer. The new algorithmic rule used was not revealed to the workers, so the riders active in the FAU union organised a meeting to share the information they had gathered thus far. First, riders from France and the UK explained over Skype how the new scheme deteriorated their working conditions.</p>
