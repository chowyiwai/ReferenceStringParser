         <abstract>
            <p>Discounted cash flow analysis is the most common method for evaluation of investment projects, yet practitioners worry about its shortcomings. In particular, there is concern that standard DCF comparisons may introduce bias against long-term investments. Here, we explore a possible source of such bias in the structure of the uncertainty underlying project cash flows, and the way it is incorporated into project discounting. Project risks usually are driven by key uncertainties that underlie the larger cash flows. The case we analyze is a common one, where the dominant risk originates in project revenues which are a function of an uncertain output price. This uncertainty can be thought of as resulting from unpredictable shocks, big and small. (If a specific example helps, think of the world oil market.) If this price tends to revert to a long-term equilibrium in the face of short-term shocks, and this fact is ignored in the analysis, then the uncertainty in the cash flows will be mis-estimated and the associated discounting will be incorrect. To identify when to be concerned about this "reversion" phenomenon, consider how a price shock today (say, a sudden run-up in price) influences expectations of prices in the near and long-term future. If near and long-term expectations change by the same proportion, then there is no reversion. This is the random-walk view of uncertain prices that, if applied to project cash flow, implicitly underlies most DCF applications. If, however, the influence of the information gained from the shock tends to decay as one looks farther into the future, then reversion is at work. One would expect this effect in circumstances where an event now is less and less relevant to the state of the economy the farther out in the future one looks. This will happen, for example, where long-term supply and demand limit how long an exceptionally "low" or "high" price can be sustained: after a shock, the price tends to revert to some "normal" long-term equilibrium. Such output price reversion has a straightforward effect on now-or-never decisions, with no operating options. The stronger the reversion, the less is the uncertainty in long-term revenues when compared to short-term. With less uncertainty, the risk discounting for long-term revenues should be reduced in relation to that for short-term revenues. This is the first of several influences of reversion on project value, called the "risk-discounting" effect. Because of it, the use of a single discount rate to value project alternatives with different operating lives will introduce a bias against the longer-term opportunities. The presence of options complicates matters. Besides the risk-discounting effect, two other influences can be identified. One is the familiar "variance effect" in option valuation: a long-term reduction in uncertainty due to reversion tends to decrease long-term option values. The other is a "future reversion" effect, which occurs where the future reversion in the price means or medians can directly influence asset values. This happens, for example, with American options through an influence on the timing of exercise. In any particular case, the overall effect of reversion can be a complicated mix of these three effects. Two sets of examples have been investigated using this three-part classification. The first are American call options on the output price, and we examine options that are currently at-the-money. We find that counteracting risk-discounting and variance effects give conflicting results for the influence of reversion on European options. However, the early exercise premium for an American option is also influenced by a future-reversion effect which increases with the degree of reversion. The net result is that neglecting reversion creates a bias against longer-term American timing options. The second set of examples involves now-or-never decisions and investment timing options for projects that produce over a series of years and which differ in their operating lives. We show how a bias against long-term alternatives can occur, in a now-or-never analysis of the projects, through the use in the valuation of the longer project of a corporate discount rate based on the valuation of the shorter one. It is a clear example of the bias against the long-term inherent in single-rate discounting. If reversion is neglected in the presence of an initial timing option, then, in our examples, bias remains against the project with a longer operating duration, even if mitigated somewhat. When considering the same operating project, however, longer timing options tend to be relatively overvalued if reversion is neglected. These results suggest that it may be useful to revisit earlier "real options" work based on random-walk models. Also, they indicate that, where market conditions are likely to yield reverting behavior, managers need to consider adjustments in discount rates for long-lived as opposed to short-lived investments.</p>
