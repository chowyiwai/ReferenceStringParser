A compensated elasticity measures the strength of the substitution effect alone, indicating the response to a price

To the extent that these taxes are simply seen as taxes on savings, they are covered by the analysis discussed in

This point is reinforced by calculations of optimal income tax schedules reported in Tuomala (1990), which show

Tuomala (1990) shows that more rapidly declining marginal rates can be desirable when different parameter

As the Mirrlees model does not explicitly include any other taxes, any comparison between model results and
actual rates should take account of all taxes that vary with income, not just the formal 'income tax'. In the UK, this
would include VAT and other sales taxes, so that the model-equivalent marginal income tax for the typical taxpayer
would include both the standard rate of income tax and the percentage of additional income that would go in sales
taxes. The question of whether National Insurance contributions should be included turns on whether they are
viewed as a tax or as savings. In the UK, the connection between marginal contributions and level of benefit is so
weak that they should probably be regarded as a tax.</mixed-citation>

The exemption level would have to be chosen so that people with no income would receive the same real payment
from the government under the two schemes. The equivalent marginal income tax rate would be lower than the
uniform sales tax rate. For example, a 100 per cent sales tax halves a person's real disposable income and so is
equivalent to a 50 per cent income tax rate.</mixed-citation>

This condition is slightly different from the Corlett and Hague result, because of the presence of the uniform
payment. It should also be noted that the Atkinson and Stiglitz result requires that the Engel curves (the relationship
between a household's demand for a good and its income) be linear, but this is not required if there is an optimal
non-linear income tax.</mixed-citation>

The equivalent child tax allowance is one which has the same budgetary cost as the child benefit. The linearity
of the tax system and its extension to households below the tax threshold (the 'negative income tax') is necessary
to ensure that, like the child benefit, the net benefit of the tax allowance is the same for all households.</mixed-citation>
