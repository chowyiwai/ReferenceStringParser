         <abstract>
            <p>B. C. Hydro is concerned about the long term storage stability of middle distillate fuels. In the first half of 1982 an extensive literature survey was initiated and various experimental approaches were evaluated. Our laboratory followed other investigators in the field. Fuel quality after aging for 12 weeks at 110째F was selected as an accelerated test for the assessment of fuel storage life. Thermal aging for 16 hours at 212째F was adopted for fast fuel screening, and the more severe conditions of 212째F for 60 to 120 hours for the testing of highly stable fuels and additives. A total of seven test fuels were tested under various conditions. Eight fuel additives were tested, and of these - three additives (so called combination additives) were found to be most effective in controlling thermal aging of ("Keogh") fuel. Initial results of ultrasound aided thermal aging at 110째F seem to indicate that the so called "induction period" is accompanied by poor aging statistics.</p>
