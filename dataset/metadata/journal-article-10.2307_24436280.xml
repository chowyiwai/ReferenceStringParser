Section 3(2)(b) Telecommunications Act 1984. This is one of several subsidiary objectives listed in
Section 3. These include: to promote the interests of consumers; to promote efficiency and economy; to
promote research; to encourage overseas companies that are major télécoms users to locate business in
the UK and to promote abroad the interests of UK télécoms firms producing services or equipment.</mixed-citation>

One way in which the link between promoting the social objectives of universal service and restricting
competition could have been broken is through the introduction of explicit external subsidy. The 1984
Act makes some provision for this. Section 93 provides for grants to promote the interests of disabled
persons and Section 97 for local authorities to make payments to public operators towards 'losses'
sustained in providing services. However, it is unlikely that these grants will replace the more important
source of funding, cross-subsidy.</mixed-citation>

The important point here is not that Mitel's share of the total PBX market was relatively small — 18 per
cent in 1984; rather, that because the embryonic independent sources of distribution were themselves
small, Mitel provided an important share of their sales.</mixed-citation>
