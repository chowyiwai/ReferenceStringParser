         <abstract>
            <p>Banks, by their very nature, specialize in evaluating risky lending situations, and their decisions to grant loans are signals to other providers of capital about the borrowers' financial strength. These other providers can evaluate these signals and can lower their own information generation costs about the borrowers by performing less costly evaluations. They can then provide their services at lower costs. Corporate and other borrowers, by signaling their credit-worthiness through bank borrowing, can lower their credit costs. Surprisingly, there is little evidence to indicate the effects of bank lending agreements on the market values of U.S. bank-holding companies (USBHCs). Banks can lend in both the domestic and foreign markets. Announcements of their domestic lending agreements may not provide capital market participants any additional information regarding the banks themselves, since these participants may already be aware of a bank's capacity to produce information. However, through their foreign lending agreements, USBHCs may be able to signal to market participants their efforts to gain benefits by exploiting market imperfections, arbitraging regulatory factors, and seeking to reduce risk through loan portfolio diversification. However, foreign lending agreements may also signal loans to more risky borrowers. Finally, foreign lending agreements expose banks to country risk involving the possibility of losses due to country-specific economic, political, and social events. The above discussion suggests that no wealth effects should be observed for announcements of domestic lending agreements. For foreign lending agreements, either positive or negative effects could be observed. These propositions are tested by analyzing 145 announcements of domestic lending agreements and 225 announcements of foreign lending agreements by 25 USBHCs over the 1968 to 1989 period. Event study methodology and regressions are utilized in the analysis. The analysis of the 145 domestic lending announcements showed abnormal returns (ARs) of 0.01% on the announcement day. The cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) for days -1 to 0, with 0 as the announcement day, and -15 to +15 were 0.15% and 0.50%, respectively. The ARs and CARs were not statistically different from zero and substantiate the conjecture that bank stock prices should not react to news about domestic lending agreements. The AR for the foreign lending announcement day was -0.14% and was not significant. However, the CARs for days -2 to 0, and -5 to +5 were -0.44% and -0.64%, respectively, and were statistically different from zero. These results suggest that bank stockholders suffer negative abnormal returns of about one-half percent over the days around the foreign lending announcements. The mean difference (foreign loans-domestic loans) of CARs for foreign and domestic lending announcements for days -5 to +5 was -0.83%. It is feasible that investor perceptions regarding country risks, arbitrage of regulatory factors, and diversification benefits may have affected CARs. Therefore, five cross-sectional regressions were estimated to examine the effects of the mentioned factors on the CARs for days -2 to 0. CAR (-2, 0) was the dependent variable in all regressions. Variance of stock returns was the independent variable in Regression (1). The regression coefficient was significant and negative, indicating that reductions in bank's total risk are associated with higher CARs. Total risk of stock returns was decomposed into its systematic and unsystematic components, which were used in the second regression. The results showed that reduction in unsystematic risk was associated with higher CARs. Lower levels of unsystematic risk are generally associated with lower levels of probability of bankruptcy. The results suggest that investors appear to positively value the diversification benefits associated with foreign lending. Another regression included a variable that captured the U.S. regulatory environment. The coefficient for this variable was marginally significant and indicated the USBHCs may have engaged in foreign lending partly in response to the laws governing them in the U.S. The results of this study provide the puzzling evidence that investor reaction to foreign lending by USBHCs has been largely negative, despite the fact that foreign lending lowers the probability of bankruptcy and allows bank managers to arbitrage the effects of some of the regulations that banks face. The results suggest that bank managers may have engaged in unsound lending practices. It is possible that these managers unwittingly invested in "bad" loans because their salaries, bonuses and commissions were tied to the total volume of loans originated, rather than to the ultimate profits from these loans. It is also possible that these loans were allocated with the best of intentions but showed the effects associated with poor training of lending officers, charging spreads too low for the risks involved, following the herd behavior, and loan pushing. The results imply that banks could have improved their performance if managerial compensation and rewards had been tied to the long-term performance of the loans being allocated by managers. The results also suggest that proper training of managers in evaluating risks in foreign lending, and charging interest rates that matched the risks, may have led to a more favorable evaluation by investors.</p>
