         <abstract>
            <p>This paper analyzes how changes to the deductibility of state and local taxes under the federal personal income tax affect local fiscal outcomes. This paper is the first to study the impact of changing tax prices on local fiscal outcomes while allowing for local heterogeneity in tax incentives at the county level. Exploiting variation at the county level yields a more elastic relationship between tax price and local spending than using coarser units of observation. Simulations suggest that limiting the deduction for state and local taxes would not disproportionately hurt resource-poor areas, making such limits potentially progressive policy options.</p>

There is a possibility that the response to the deductibility of sales taxes post-2003 is attenuated due to the
fact that the deductibility status was passed as a temporary provision that needed to be renewed every two
years. However, this potential attenuation would only affect a handful of states (those who do not have an
income tax) in two years (2004 and 2005) of my sample.</mixed-citation>

The coefficient estimates are mostly insignificant, but this is largely due to the choice to cluster standard

Because revenue centralization is measured as a ratio of state revenue to state and local combined revenue,
this also makes the interpretation of the estimated coefficients much clearer, as it removes the dependent
variable (a state's current state and local revenue collections) from the right-hand side of the equation.
The test yields a large first-stage F-statistic, signaling a highly-relevant instrument.</mixed-citation>
