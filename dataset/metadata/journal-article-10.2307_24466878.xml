         <abstract>
            <p>We examine the effect of a permanent change to a country corporate income repatriation tax system on corporate financial policies. In 2009, Japan and the United Kingdom switched from a worldwide system to a territorial system for the taxation of repatriated foreign earnings, effectively reducing the tax liabilities of most multinational firms when repatriating earnings. We find that after the change firms accumulate less cash, pay out larger amounts through dividends and share repurchases, and invest less abroad. We do not find that the tax system change has significantly affected domestic investments even when controlling for capital constraints.</p>

As stated by the 2013 IMF Fiscal Monitor Report Survey, these tax avoidance techniques are implemented by
multinational firms in both advanced and developing economies. However, the problem is less acute in Japan
because Tax Heaven Counter Measure Laws effectively limit tax avoidance schemes via tax heavens.</mixed-citation>

Let us consider a Japanese multinational firm with a cost of capital of 11%. This firm needs to repatriate cash
to invest in a project that will generate $150 M in cash flows next year and will require an investment of $100
M this year (the NPV is therefore $35.1 M). The cash could be repatriated from a Dutch subsidiary. The Dutch
subsidiary also has an investment opportunity that could generate $135 M next year and requires a $100 M
investment this year (the NPV is $21.6 M). In the absence of repatriation taxes, the cash would be repatriated
to invest in the more lucrative domestic project. Under the worldwide tax system, the foreign project would
be chosen instead. The statutory corporate tax in the Netherlands is 25.5%, whereas it is 40.69% in Japan. The
15.19% difference on the $ 100 M would be paid upon repatriation. Therefore, approximately $ 118 M would need
to be repatriated to have $100 M after tax to invest in the domestic project (118*( 1-0.1519) = 100). Effectively,
therefore, the domestic project requires an investment of $ 118 M, reducing the NPV to $ 17.1 M, which is lower
than the NPV of the foreign project. Hartman (1985) argues that under the worldwide system if the after-tax rate
of return abroad is higher (lower) than the domestic net rate of return, the firm would invest abroad and repatriate
in the following period (repatriate immediately and invest domestically). However, if there is an expectation of
a tax holiday or a territorial tax system reform in one of the following periods, the firm is more likely to reinvest
in foreign projects even when their returns are lower, consistent with our hypothesis and numerical example.</mixed-citation>

In unreported results, we also repeat all of our tests using a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation approach,
in which we compare changes in financial policy variables for a treated group of companies that are affected by
the tax law change (i.e., multinational firms) with a control group of companies that are not affected by the tax
change (i.e., purely domestic firms). The results are qualitatively identical.</mixed-citation>
