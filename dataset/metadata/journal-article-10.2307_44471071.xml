         <abstract>
            <p>This paper presents an overview of the design process used in the development of an electronic diesel engine control system for industrial, or off-highway applications. The product development process is presented from a systems engineering perspective with emphasis on the key systems engineering methods utilized. One of the major differences between onhighway and off–highway markets is the diversity of applications the off-highway market represents. The industrial controller strives to meet the needs of those diverse applications by employing a large degree of flexibility not only in the way the individual features can be utilized but also in the way the whole system can be applied Successful incorporation of that flexibility can be attributed to establishing a clear understanding of both the common and unique aspects of the off–highway market and considering those aspects from a total system perspective throughout the development process.</p>
