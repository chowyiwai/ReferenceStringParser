         <abstract>
            <p>We show that wrongful discharge laws—laws that protect employees against unjust dismissal—spur innovation and new firm creation. Wrongful discharge laws, particularly those that prohibit employers from acting in bad faith ex post, limit employers' ability to hold up innovating employees after the innovation is successful. By reducing the possibility of holdup, these laws enhance employees' innovative efforts and encourage firms to invest in risky but potentially mould-breaking projects. We develop a model and provide supporting empirical evidence of this effect using the staggered adoption of wrongful discharge laws across U.S. states.</p>

unobservables, whereas U.S. studies investigating the impact of federal labor law encounter difficulties in

For instance, although precommitted severance packages may be written upfront to address the holdup problem,
they would in general be "incomplete" given the indescribability of all ex post outcomes in such contracts. In
other words, the extent of commitment the firm provides by agreeing to incur the cost of severance packages
would be insufficient in some states of the world to avoid the holdup problem.</mixed-citation>

Pakes and Schankerman (1984) show that the distribution of the importance of patents is extremely skewed, that
is, most of the value is concentrated in a small number of patents. Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2005), among
others, demonstrate that patent citations are a good measure of the value of innovations.</mixed-citation>

The NCA enforcement score, as well as the Ratio of value added are only available from 1976 and 1977
onward, respectively. The point estimates and significance of the main explanatory variables vary slightly across
specifications with and without control variables. As we show in Online Appendix Table A1 and the corresponding
discussion, these differences are due to the impact of the control variables rather than the change in sample size.</mixed-citation>

We broadly follow Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006) in constructing this graph. The graph plots the point
estimates and 90% confidence intervals (based on standard errors that are clustered by state of location of the
patent assignee) of the parameters ßT from the following regression:
yist=ßt+ X ßT*Good_faithTst+eist,
where yiS/ is the log of the number of citations (+1) received for patents applied for in year t by patent assignee
i in state s. Good_faithxst is a variable indicating the year relative to the adoption of a good-faith exception in
state s and year t. For example, Good_faith®t is a variable taking the value of one in the year of adoption of
the good-faith clause in state s and year t and is zero otherwise; Good__faith^t is a variable taking the value of
one in the sixth year after adoption of the good-faith clause in state s and year t and is zero otherwise. ßt is a set
of year dummies. The time span underlying the regressions is 1970-1999; patent data is from the NBER Patents
File (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg 2001), with data limited to patent assignees residing in the United States.</mixed-citation>

We define Competition as the fraction of total (two-digit SIC) industry sales generated by competitors in a
given state. The state corresponds to the location of the firm's headquarters; Howells (1990) and Breschi (2008)

To construct the variable Ratio of value added, we obtain data on the gross state product (GSP) per sector, state

sixty-three BEA sectors to eighteen sectors based on the BEA classification of two-digit SIC codes. In each year,

For example, the precedent setting case in California (Cleary v. American Airlines, Inc. (10/29/80), 168 Cal.
Rptr. 722 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980)) involved an airline employee who argued that he was wrongfully dismissed by
his former long-term employer, American Airlines, Inc. During the trial, the court decided that it was necessary
to extend contracting principles from another law domain into employment contracts. Specifically, the court
concluded that the "concept of good faith and fair dealing was first formulated by the California courts in
insurance contracts. But, it is clear that it has reference to all contracts."</mixed-citation>

In particular, California was not only the first state to adopt a wrongful discharge law but also the state whose
Court of Appeals ruled on the most influential good-faith case according to legal scholars (Cleary v. American
Airlines, 1980). Furthermore, the good-faith exception in California was the most far-reaching one, at least in the
first decade after the ruling. This exception barred Californian employers from dismissing any worker without
good cause (see Autor, Kerr, and Kugler 2007). Finally, Californian state courts tended to be most receptive to
wrongful discharge litigation (see Edelman, Abraham, and Erlanger 1992).</mixed-citation>

In our Theoretical Motivation, we argued that the passage of WDL enabled firms to commit to their employees
not to hold them up in the case of successful innovation. Therefore, a possible alternative interpretation for our
results is that innovation-driven firms (re-)located to states that offered their employees greater protection against
wrongful discharge. As California and Massachusetts arguably provided the strongest legal protection of this
type, firms pursuing innovation may have been inclined to relocate to either California or Massachusetts after
the passage of these laws. If this alternative interpretation were true, the passage of WDL would significantly
further innovation in California and Massachusetts, but not in the other states. However, as our results are robust
to the exclusion of California and Massachusetts from the sample, this does not appear to be the case.</mixed-citation>

Another alternative interpretation of our results may be that passage of WDL leads to firms filing more patents
because the adoption of these laws may be correlated with an increase in the probability of intellectual property
litigation. In other words, is it the case that our results are an outcome of firms' increased efforts to protect
themselves against intellectual property litigation? Because citations to patents capture the economic value of
an innovation, our results indicate that not only do firms file more patents after the passage of WDL but they file
more valuable patents. An effort to patent more to protect against possible litigation should not necessarily lead
to firms filing more valuable patents.</mixed-citation>

This empirical prediction is consistent with the Xerox view of entrepreneurial spawning highlighted by Gompers,
Lerner, and Scharfstein (2005), where entrepreneurial spawning from incumbent firms is high not because of any

"core competence."</mixed-citation>
