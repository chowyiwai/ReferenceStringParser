            <p>Dislocations occur when financial markets, operating under stressful conditions, experience large, widespread asset mispricings. This study documents systematic dislocations in world capital markets and the importance of their fluctuations for expected asset returns. Our novel, model-free measure of these dislocations is a monthly average of hundreds of individual abnormal absolute violations of three textbook arbitrage parities in stock, foreign exchange, and money markets. We find that investors demand statistically and economically significant risk premiums to hold financial assets performing poorly during market dislocations, that is, when both frictions to the trading activity of speculators and arbitrageurs and their marginal utility of wealth are likely to be high.</p>

For instance, Kashyap, Berner, and Goodhart (2011) argue that a satisfactory "macroprudential toolkit" should
include instruments to assess and prevent the occurrence of price dislocations in financial markets because they are
likely to magnify the effects of a financial crisis on economic performance. Accordingly, new macroprudential
authorities, such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), or the
Financial Policy Committee (FPC), have been charged with the responsibility of identifying dislocations in
financial markets and mitigating the risk of widespread financial distress (e.g., Agresti, Borgioli, and Poloni
2011; ESRB 2012; Brinkhoff et al. 2013).</mixed-citation>

A comprehensive survey of this vast body of literature is beyond the scope of this paper. Recent studies find
violations of the triangular arbitrage parity (Lyons and Moore 2009; Kozhan and Tham 2012), covered interest
rate parity (Akram, Rime, and Sarno 2008; Coffey et al. 2009; Griffoli and Ranaldo 2011), cross-listed stock
pairs parity (Pasquariello 2008; Gagnon and Karolyi 2010), Siamese twins parity (Mitchell, Pulvino, and Stafford
2002), closed-end fund parity (Pontiff 1996), exchange-traded fund parity (Chacko, Das, and Fan 2012), TIPS-
Treasury arbitrage parity (Campbell, Shiller, and Viceira 2009; Fleckenstein, Longstaff, and Lustig 2013), off-the-
run Treasury bond-note parity (Musto, Nini, and Schwarz 2011), CDS-bond yield parity (Duffie 2010; Garleanu
and Pedersen 2011), convertible bond parity (Mitchell and Pulvino 2010), futures-cash parity (Roll, Schwartz,
and Subrahmanyam 2007), and put-call parity (Lamont and Thaler 2003a; Ofek, Richardson, and Whitelaw

Arbitrage activity may be impeded by such financial frictions as transaction costs, taxes, (inventory) holding
costs, exchange controls, illiquidity, short-sale and other investment restrictions (surveyed in Gagnon and
Karolyi [2010]), information problems (Grossman and Miller 1988), agency problems (De Long et al. 1990;
Shleifer and Vishny 1997), idiosyncratic risk (Pontiff 2006), (counterparty) default risk (e.g., Adler and Dumas

cost of capital (Pontiff 1996) supply factors (Fleckenstein, Longstaff, and Lustig 2013), fire sales and market

LIBOR rates are computed by the British Bankers Association (BBA) as arithmetic averages of contributor
banks' interbank offers at around 11 a.m. GMT. For simplicity and uniformity across exchange rates (e.g., when
considering national holidays, weekends, special circumstances for fixing and value dates, as well as evolving
day-count conventions [and their different, possibly conflicting interpretations] over the sample period; see, e.g.,
Miron and Swannell 1991; Deng et al. 2012), interest rates are compounded using a 30/360 convention. The
effect of employing "market" day-count conventions (when feasible) on our analysis is immaterial.</mixed-citation>

Investigations by media and regulators suggest that some of the LIBOR contributor banks may have under-
reported their offer rates to the BBA during the recent financial crisis (e.g., see the coverage of the LIBOR
probe on the Wall Street Journal Web site, at http://stream.wsj.com/story/the-libor-investigation/SS-2-32262/).
This is unlikely to meaningfully affect our analysis. Griffoli and Ranaldo (2011) compute similarly large CIRP
violations in 2008 and 2009 to those in Figure la when using alternative (secured and unsecured) interest rates
(in the repo and overnight index swap [OIS] markets, respectively). Furthermore, all of our ensuing inference is
insensitive to removing 2008 and 2009 from the sample (see Section 1.3).</mixed-citation>

We filter this dataset for errors (and unreasonably large TAP deviations) using the same procedure employed for
CIRP deviations in Section 2.1.1. We also verify that observed TAP violations in our dataset are not due to rounding
of prices from Equation (2) and/or from direct-to-indirect quote conversion (i.e., from StA/B = (St,B/A) *)â¢

We note here that DEM, FRF, and ITL exit our database only on the first trading day of the euro (January 4,1999),
leaving 60 TAP permutations in T A Pm. Removing cross-rates relative to FRL and ITL from the full sample has
little impact on T A Pm. Kozhan and Tham (2012) report TAP violations (net of bid-ask spreads) of comparable

A minority of companies, mostly Canadian, cross-list their stock in the U.S. in the form of ordinary shares.
"Canadian" ordinaries are identical certificates trading in both the U.S. and a foreign market (i.e., with a bundling
ratio of one; see Bekaert and Hodrick 2009); "global registered shares" (GRSs) are ordinaries trading in multiple
foreign markets. In the U.S., ordinaries trade like U.S. firms' stock, require no depositary bank, but are subject to
specific clearing and transfer arrangements. The literature typically groups ordinaries together with ADRs (e.g.,

The number of cross-listings from emerging markets prior to their financial liberalizations is small in our sample.
Accordingly, excluding from the analysis cross-listings from those countries over the portion of the sample when
these restrictions were in place has virtually no effect on our inference. In addition, as we explain in Section 1.2,
our index of financial market dislocations is based on differences between observed arbitrage parity violations
and their historical means, as the latter may capture the persistent effect of those direct barriers to arbitrage.
We examine the relation between financial market dislocations and explicit measures of time-varying capital
controls in Section 1.3 (footnote 25).</mixed-citation>

For instance, Gagnon and Karolyi (2010) address nonsynchronicity between foreign stock and ADR prices by
employing available intraday price and quote data for the latter (from TAQ) at a time corresponding to the closing
time of the equity market for the underlying (if their trading hours are at least partially overlapping). However,
the trading hours of Asian markets do not overlap with U.S. trading hours. In addition, TAQ data is available

For instance, several recent studies use equal-weighted cross-sectional averages of stock-level liquidity measures
(i.e., potentially affected by idiosyncratic shocks) to produce a more precise assessment of commonality in
liquidity (Amihud 2002; Pastor and Stambaugh 2003; Acharya and Pedersen 2005). Monthly averaging smooths
potentially spurious daily variability in these normalized arbitrage parity violations (e.g., due to price staleness
or nonsynchronicity), but at the potential cost of aggregating away shorter-lived abnormal mispricings (i.e., of
underestimating dislocation risk). According to Figures Id to If, CIRP^, TAP^, and ADRPÂ£ are statistically
significant, at the 10% level, in 47% (and also positive in 11%), 46% (41%), and 72% (8%) of all available months

The above inference is unaffected by the further inclusion of the difference between the VIX index and realized
S&amp;P 500 return volatility (a proxy for time-varying variance risk premiums in the U.S. stock market; Bollerslev
et al. 2009) or the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' financial stress index (capturing the comovement of 18
financial variables such as stock and bond returns and return volatility, various yield spreads, and TIPS breakeven
inflation rates) in the regressions of Table 2. In unreported analysis, we also find M DIm to be only weakly related
to the measure of U.S. investor sentiment introduced by Baker and Wurgler (2006, 2007; e.g., a slope coefficient
of -0.014 [r = â 1.42] over 1973-2009) and to either cross-country averages of the unsmoothed or price-smoothed
proxy for the intensity of capital controls in emerging markets proposed by Edison and Warnock (2003; e.g., slope

Unreported analysis yields similar inference from studying either a larger (100) or a smaller (10) number of
portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market. Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) argue that the strong factor
structure of size and book-to-market portfolios makes asset pricing tests based on the cross-section of their returns
potentially misleading, and suggest (among others) constructing portfolios of stocks sorted by their loadings on
the proposed factor. We do so in Section 2.1.3.</mixed-citation>

Annualized risk premium estimates are computed multiplying monthly estimates by 12. Their t-statistics are
obtained by applying the errors-in-variables correction described in Shanken's (1992) to the corresponding
conventional standard errors. Because of M Dim's relatively large variance (see, e.g., Panel B of Table 1), this
correction has virtually no effect on the inference. The joint GMM estimation of Ãi^MDI ^ kjDl m Section

For instance, Cochrane (2001, 441) observes that a typical value firm "has a price that has been driven down
from a long string of bad news, and is now in or near financial distress. Stocks bought on the verge of bankruptcy
have come back more often than not, which generates the high average returns of this strategy. This observation
suggests a natural interpretation of the value premium: If a credit crunch, liquidity crunch, flight to quality or
similar financial event comes along, stocks in financial distress will do very badly, and this is just the sort of time
at which one particularly does not want to hear that one's stocks have become worthless!"</mixed-citation>

estimates of &gt;^mdi Ãi,MDl after accounting for priced sensitivities to the three, four, or five aforementioned
