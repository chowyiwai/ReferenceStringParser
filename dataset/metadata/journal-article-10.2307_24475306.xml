         <abstract>
            <p>This paper investigates the influence of different financing channels—bond issuance or bank loans—as well as debt maturity and the quality of financial reporting on the cost of debt in China. The authors find that conservative accounting is an important characteristic of high-quality financial reporting that can reduce the cost of longer maturity debt such as bank loans and bonds. Even state-owned enterprises, which have fewer financial constraints than non–state-owned enterprises, benefit from accounting conservatism's ability to reduce financial costs. Moreover, the findings indicate that bond investors are concerned about the issuer's fundamentals, while banks are more likely to focus on the operation and bankruptcy risk of borrowers.</p>

Since both ownership structure and capital structure affect reporting policy, conservative
reporting may be the intermediate variable, not the determinant variable. Actually this relationship
can show the role conservative reporting plays in debt financing, namely, that investors and banks
judge risk based on conservative accounting. In general, conservative accounting is an important
characteristic of high-quality accounting information and plays an important role in reducing
information asymmetry. Of course, in order to reduce the influence of the ownership structure on
financing costs, we control for those factors in empirical regressions.</mixed-citation>

Conservative accounting will lead to lower current accounting earnings, significantly af-
fecting profitability, which is the key risk measure in bank lending. In particular, conservative
accounting has a negative influence on borrowing due to its negative effect on earnings. Thus,
for short-term debt financing, although conservative accounting may help obtain debt financing,
it may also have the opposite effect. Thus, the relationship between conservative accounting and
financing costs is not clear.</mixed-citation>

Comparable loan interest rates are the interest rates on bank loans that have the same matu-
rity and are issued at the same time as bonds in public bond markets. We also use the comparable
deposit interest rate; the results are basically the same. To save space, they are not reported in the
main text.</mixed-citation>

Ball et al. (2008) find that the influence of conservatism on debt pricing is mostly due to
conditional conservatism, not unconditional conservatism. The measure of conservatism in our
paper, the cumulative accrual, actually consists of both aspects. Therefore, we compare conditional
and overall conservatism and find that both have improved since 2001 in China, as do Xia and Zhu
(2009). Overall conservatism can be a proxy for conservatism. Givoly et al. (2007) suggest that
a single measurement for conservatism has too much measurement error, so we use other kinds
of conservatism, such as market value to book value (M/B) (Feltham and Ohlson 1995; Khan
and Watts 2009; Moerman 2008) and the C-score developed by Khan and Watts (2009) based on
Basu's (1997) model.</mixed-citation>

Conserv is the same as Conservl'. three-year cumulative accruals are multiplied by -1, thus
the higher this measure, the higher the accounting conservatism (Ahmed and Duellman 2007; Xia
and Zhu 2009). The accruals for each year are equal to earnings minus cash flow from operations,
divided by total assets at year end. We also use Conserv2 and the results are basically the same.
To save space, we do not report the results.
Due to limited information, we do not have the Z-score. Thus this regression does not include
this variable.</mixed-citation>
