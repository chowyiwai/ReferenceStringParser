         <abstract xml:lang="eng">
            <p>ASPECT: RATIOS is the outgrowth of a program developed by the CTBUH Young Professionals Committee in New York, beginning in 2016. The purpose of the lecture series, and of this special edition, is to showcase some of the exemplary work done by women in the tall building field. The impediments and setbacks faced by women in a male-dominated field are an infrequently discussed reality. CTBUH invited female colleagues to reflect on their experiences as women in a variety of roles and disciplines. We provided preliminary questions, but did not presume what subjects would be of most interest, and thus our invitation was very open-ended. The responses we received in some cases addressed gender inequality head-on; in others, colleagues held forth on a subject of personal importance to them. In all cases, the goal is the same: we want these voices to be heard. With a greater number of women entering the science and technology field, the conversation about their contribution to the tall building industry is more relevant than ever before.</p>
