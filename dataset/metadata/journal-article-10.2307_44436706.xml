         <abstract>
            <p>SIX-WHEEL trucks, which originated on the Pacific Coast, are asserted to be a new and worthy tool that is based on sound engineering principles and meets a real demand for an economical transportation unit. Although the design has not yet been perfected, the vehicle is making creditable history for itself and the author asserts will be a permanent type. He refers to roadimpact tests as evidence of its ability to carry heavy loads with less destructive effect to the roads and its own mechanism than would occur with the four-wheel truck. The industry is urged to conduct an educational campaign and recommend appropriate State legislation that will permit reasonable and just gross weight. Six-wheel trucks are classified by the kind of axles used, as dead or driving; weight distribution is discussed and mechanical details of present constructions are described at length. Much attention is given to the question of the use of a third differential in the four-wheel-drive bogie to divide or equalize the power to the two sides of the truck, and opposed views of engineers are quoted in an appendix. Tire wear also is considered at length, with reports on this phase embodied in a second appendix. The author has followed six-wheel-truck development closely for a number of years and in this paper brings the reader up to date on the subject in an interesting way.</p>
