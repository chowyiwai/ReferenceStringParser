         <abstract>
            <p>Corporate managers frequently announce corporate distributions, including stock splits, stock dividends, special dividends, and increases in regular dividends, on the anniversary of a like announcement at the same firm. The market appears to not fully appreciate the implications of current distributions for future distributions and stock returns, as a simple strategy that involves purchasing firms with high predicted probabilities of distribution announcements earns significant abnormal monthly returns. These results are distinct from previously documented return regularities related to regular earnings and dividend announcements and return seasonality.</p>

Including share repurchases in a study of distribution events is also natural. However, Banyi, Dyl, and Kahle
(2008) document significant errors in share repurchase announcement dates. Despite these errors, we document
(Figure Al of the Internet Appendix) a degree of calendar-based recurrence in the repurchase announcement
dates in the SDC Platinum database for the 1980 to 2012 period.</mixed-citation>

To ensure that we rely on accounting data that would have been available to investors, we use ROA and cash
holdings data from the fiscal year that ends in calendar year Y-l as the explanatory variables in the hazard model
from July of year Y to June of year Y +1. To increase the usable sample size, we replace missing ROA and cash
holding data with the market median in the fiscal year when estimating the probability of a follow-on dividend
increase or a follow-on special dividend. In unreported results (available upon request), we find that excluding
the observations with missing ROA and cash balance does not alter our results.</mixed-citation>

To estimate the probability of a follow-on event during the first ten years of our sample period (1963-1972),
we rely on distribution data prior to 1963. In light of the evidence that the predictability mainly stems from
calendar-related recurrence, we replace missing ROA and cash-holding data with the market median in the fiscal
year to increase the usable data points.</mixed-citation>

We also assess the effect of selecting stocks on the basis of high absolute predicted event probabilities, rather
than of high relative (K = 1 % and K=5%) probabilities. In particular, we form portfolios of stocks with estimated
probabilities of a follow-on corporate event above the cutoffs of X = (5%, 10%, 20%, or 40%). The resulting
alpha estimates are reported in Table A3 of the Internet Appendix and are uniformly positive and significant at
the 1% level.</mixed-citation>

An alternative would be to exclude stocks that announced earnings rather than those expected to announce
earnings. An effect would be that stocks that unexpectedly did not announce earnings, that is, that were late
in announcing earnings, would then be retained. However, this event would be informative if it occurred. This
analysis is restricted to the post-January 1973 period (following Frazzini and Lamont 2006), because of the poor
coverage of earnings announcement dates in the Compustat database before 1973.</mixed-citation>
