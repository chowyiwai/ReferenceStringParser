         <abstract>
            <p>By both effect and example, tax policy in the United States has a huge impact on the rest of the world. This paper explores five features of the American tax system that seem, from a British and European perspective, to be both especially peculiar and potentially instructive. These are: the remarkably low overall level of taxation; the absence of a value added tax (or any other general national tax on consumption); the absence of any explicit interstate equalisation; the marginal subsidisation of low earnings under the Earned Income Tax Credit; and the fragmentation of power in policymaking, an important aspect of which is the role played by the Constitution.</p>

All states other than Vermont have balanced budget rules, of some form, intended to ensure that current

borrowing, the ratios of deficit and debt to GDP in 1993 were around 5.3 and 84 per cent respectively.)</mixed-citation>

Indeed, there is no entirely clean economic distinction between equalisation payments â in the sense of
unconditional horizontal transfers â and conditional grants: the same pattern of transfers may be represented
in many different ways, with different 'equalisation' components. This reflects the familiar point that a
conditional block grant that is smaller than the amount that the recipient state would otherwise spend on the
item concerned is, in principle, equivalent to an unconditional grant of the same amount. The flypaper effect'
â the feature that grants do not seem as fungible in practice as this argument implies (for reasons that remain
unclear: see Hines and Thaler (1995)) â diminishes the force of the argument, but the point remains: the
concept of an equalisation payment is not well defined.</mixed-citation>

One finds, for instance, the regression line

standard errors. Alaska is excluded, being a clear outlier; inclusion results in a strongly significant positive
coefficient on per capita GSP â that is, a strongly perverse distributional effect. The data are from US Bureau

The closest UK relative to the E1TC â family credit â operates by bringing earned income up towards some
target level that depends on family composition, and thus implies a strictly positive marginal tax rate. See
Walker and Wiseman (this issue) for an intriguing direct comparison between the EITC and family credit.</mixed-citation>

This result, established by Kanbur, Keen and Tuomala (1994), requires that it be optimal for all to work.
Altruism defined over the consumption of the poor has similar implications, as is shown by Oswald (1983): it
is optimal to subsidise earnings, and hence consumption, because, when making their labour-supply decisions,
the poor neglect the benefit that their consumption conveys on others â an argument, interestingly, that runs
almost exactly counter to that of Persson ( 1995) discussed above.</mixed-citation>

There are others that, for brevity, we do not develop here. Complementarities between skilled and unskilled
labour, for example, may create a case for subsidising the earnings of the unskilled: see Allen (1982). In an
efficiency wage setting, to give another example, it may be better to support the low-paid by means of a wage
subsidy than by a lump-sum transfer: for while the effect of the latter is to reduce the net income of the poor
(Ravallion, 1984), the effect of the former, it can be shown, is to increase it.</mixed-citation>

An overall assessment of the incidence of the E1TC would also need to take account of the effect of the ranges
in which the subsidy is constant and then phased out; this lends a progressivity to the tax structure that one
might expect to encourage employment and depress net wages (there then being some advantage to having
several low-paid workers rather than a few high-paid ones): see Koskela and Vilmunen (1996).</mixed-citation>
