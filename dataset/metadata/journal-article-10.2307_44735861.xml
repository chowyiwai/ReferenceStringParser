         <abstract>
            <p>It is common practice throughout the airline industry to promote
                            technicians into leadership or managerial positions after a period of
                            demonstrated proficiency as maintenance professionals. Research by
                            Purdue University strongly suggests, however, that many of these
                            technicians find themselves in a position which imposes the need for
                            knowledge or skills which they do not possess. While these individuals
                            have found excellence in their technical pursuits, most find it
                            difficult to attain excellence in their new positions due to the lack of
                            adequate training and definition of job expectations. There appears to be a generalized assumption across the aviation industry
                            that good technicians have the intrinsic knowledge and skills to become
                            good leaders and managers. Experience has proven, however, that this is
                            an unrealistic expectation. Research has shown that many of these
                            technicians are confused about the true nature of their job and
                            expectations concerning their performance. In addition to not
                            understanding the full scope and detail of their position
                            responsibilities, many of these technical leaders and managers express
                            frustration concerning their lack of skills in dealing with task work
                            flow control, project management, production measurements and data
                            analysis, and managing people. In an industry which is moving more
                            aggressively toward teamcentered and empowered work cultures, nowhere
                            are these deficiencies more apparent than in so called "people
                            skills". This paper explores the generalized inadequacy across the industry to
                            provide training opportunities for the requisite knowledge and skill
                            development of technicians promoted to leadership positions in industry
                            maintenance work environments. It discusses the research findings on
                            specific deficiencies in knowledge and skills noted for several
                            positions as well as the expressed feelings and frustrations of
                            individuals within those positions. The paper also proposes methods for
                            conducting a needs assessment of specific work environments to identify
                            the knowledge and skills necessary for a technician to thrive in their
                            new position.</p>
