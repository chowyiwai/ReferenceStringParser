            <p>ACCESSORY items are defined by Col. Holliday as that equipment not essential to flight. They are the items added to make the airplane easier to handle and safer to operate. One simple and efficient way of obtaining the power to drive the accessories is by direct mechanical take-off from the engine. Use of this method is restricted because of space limitations in the rear of the engine where the unit must be located. The next method considered is the use of hydraulic power. Although it has a lighter fixed weight, as compared with electrical units, there are disadvantages such as high loss in efficiency in cold weather. A pneumatic system – also possible – is not satisfactory because of a definite control lag. The final system discussed by Col. Holliday is the electrical one. Its one chief disadvantage, that of excessive weight, is being rapidly overcome, making it seem as if the use of electrical power is definitely the coming thing. In the matter of transmission, the electrical is far more efficient than the hydraulic system – and this advantage becomes even more apparent as the length of the transmission lines increases. Electric wires are also quite invulnerable. Voltage and its hydraulic counterpart – pressure – must also be considered. A standard of 24 v is now being used, a figure that can be increased almost without limit, whereas hydraulic pressures already seem to be approaching their upper limits.</p>
