This is illustrated by the fact that this study considers six income components. In the methodology used by Cancian
et al. ( 1993) and Machin and Waldfogel ( 1994), this would have led to 15 interaction terms. Much of the analysis,
to date, of inequality decomposition by factor components — Jenkins (1995) being an exception — has suffered
from this defect.</mixed-citation>

Married couples that reported negative amounts of any type of factor income (in practice, this was on earnings
and investment income) were dropped from the sample. The top percentile of married couples were also dropped
from the sample since their incomes were very much out of line with the rest of the sample.</mixed-citation>

It is interesting to note that there appears to be discontinuity between 1989 and 1990, with a drop of three
percentage points in the proportion of single-earner couples and a corresponding rise in the proportion of two-earner
couples. Furthermore, this discontinuity is in spite of the adjustment made for the potential under-reporting, prior
to 1990, of childless, cohabiting couples (who are also likely to be dual-earner couples) by the FES.</mixed-citation>

As measured by the square of the coefficient of variation, i.e. the variance of the distribution divided by the

Such decreases in inequality that occurred over the period were relatively rare, with only four (1982,1984, 1989
and 1991) of the 14 years showing inequality decreases over the previous year; they were also small relative to
the inequality increases that occurred over the period.</mixed-citation>

This last result can be compared with that of other studies. Both Cancian, Danziger and Gottschalk (1993) and
Machin and Waldfogel (1994) measured the impact of wives' earnings on family income inequality by comparing
the actual distribution of family income with what it would have been had wives' earnings been set to zero. For
the US, Cancian et al. found that, over 1968-88, wives' earnings reduced inequality (as measured by the square
of the coefficient of variation) by about 20 per cent. For Britain, Machin and Waldfogel concluded that wives'
earnings reduced inequality by about 27 per cent in 1989-90.</mixed-citation>
