&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An ideal introduction to PCI DSS v3.2.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All businesses that accept payment cards are prey for criminal
hackers trying to steal financial information and commit identity
fraud. The PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
exists to ensure that businesses process credit and debit card
payments in a way that effectively protects cardholder data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All organisations that accept, store, transmit or process
cardholder data must comply with the Standard; failure to do so can
have serious consequences and expensive repercussions. These range
from customer desertion and brand damage to significant financial
penalties and operating restrictions imposed by their acquiring
bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covering PCI DSS v3.2.1, this handy pocket guide provides all
the information you need to consider as you approach the Standard.
It is also an ideal training resource for those in your
organisation involved with payment card processing. Topics
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of PCI DSS v3.2.1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How to comply with the requirements of the Standard&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Maintaining compliance&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The PCI SAQ (self-assessment questionnaire)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The PCI DSS and ISO 27001&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Procedures and qualifications&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An overview of the PA-DSS (Payment Application Data Security
Standard)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;PTS (PIN Transaction Security)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Software-based PIN entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                     <p>All target dates for compliance with the PCI DSS have long since passed. The Standard is now on its third version, with the fourth in development with a predicted release date of Q4 2020. It is likely that v3.2.1 will be withdrawn around the end of 2021. Many organisations around the world – particularly those that fall below the top tier of payment card transaction volumes – are not yet compliant.</p>
                     <p>There are three possible reasons for this.</p>
                     <p>The first is that, outside a few US states, the PCI DSS has no legal status: it is not a law and</p>

There are two options for demonstrating compliance: an annual on-site security audit by a QSA or ISA and the submission of four passing quarterly network scans by an ASV, or completion of a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and the submission of four passing quarterly network scans. Which option applies is determined by an organisation’s transaction volume and whether or not it has previously suffered a security breach.</p>

                     <p>All merchants and their service providers are required to comply with the PCI DSS in its entirety and, if they are eligible for self-assessment, to attest that they comply by using the standard Attestation of Compliance (AoC) document. New SAQs and AoCs were released in 2018 to meet the requirements of version 3.2.1 of the PCI DSS.</p>
                     <p>In most recent versions of the questionnaire, there were nine validation categories (<italic>see Table</italic> 3), each</p>

                     <p>The PA-DSS is the PCI SSC-managed programme that focuses on payment applications, such as shopping carts, payment gateways, and so on. This programme was previously run by Visa Inc. and was known as Payment Application Best Practices (PABP). Increasingly, criminals are targeting vulnerabilities in payment applications to steal payment card data, and some users may unknowingly have sensitive card data stored on their systems by software. The PA-DSS is therefore meant to help software vendors and others develop secure payment applications that do not store prohibited data, such as full magnetic stripes, CVV2 or personal identification number (PIN) data, and</p>

                     <p>The PCI SSC publishes a standard for software-based PIN entry on COTS devices, such as smartphones and tablets. The PCI Software-Based PIN Entry (SPoC) Standard provides a software-based approach for protecting PIN entry on the wide variety of COTS devices on the market today. The security requirements are for solution providers to use in developing secure solutions that enable EMV contact and contactless transactions with PIN entry on the merchant’s consumer device using a secure PIN entry application in combination with a Secure Card Reader for PIN (SCRP).</p>
