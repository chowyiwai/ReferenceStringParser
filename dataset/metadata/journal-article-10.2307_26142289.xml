         <abstract>
            <p>We study the key drivers of security design in the residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) market during the run-up to the subprime mortgage crisis. We show that deals with a higher level of equity tranche have a significantly lower delinquency rate conditional on observable loan characteristics. The effect is concentrated within pools with a higher likelihood of asymmetric information between deal sponsors and potential buyers of the securities. Further, securities sold from high-equity-tranche deals command higher prices conditional on their credit ratings. Overall, our results show that the goal of security design in this market was not only to exploit regulatory arbitrage, but also to mitigate information frictions that were pervasive in this market.</p>

For example, issues surrounding the equity tranche of securitization deals form an important part of the Dodd-
Frank Reform Act. In discussing the effects of risk retention requirements pursuant to the Section 946 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Treasury secretary stressed the importance
of this tool in mitigating some contracting frictions and notes that: "... the academic literature on risk retention
with respect to asset-backed securitization is limited." Scharfstein and Sunderam (2011) examine some other
recent policy proposals and provide suggestions for the more broad reform of the housing finance system.</mixed-citation>

Pooling equilibrium is also a possibility within the information-based view. Under pooling equilibrium, we
should again not find any association between the level of the equity tranche and pool quality since sponsors
with low pool quality mimic the ones with high pool quality in such equilibrium. We focus on the predictions
from a separating equilibrium.</mixed-citation>

An originate-to-hold model of lending can be viewed as a limiting case of an RMBS deal for which the entire
stake is kept by the originating bank. From that perspective, our empirical findings are consistent with the basic
idea of this literature: as the seller's stake in the deal increases, the underlying loans perform better in the future.</mixed-citation>

Finally, we check the annual reports of major sponsors in our sample and find significant retention on their
balance sheets. For example, Lehman Brothers had approximately $2 billion of non-investment-grade retained
interests in residential mortgaged-backed securitization as of November 30, 2006. We obtain similar evidence
from the annual reports of Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch during this period. For example, Goldman Sachs'
2005 annual report states, "During the years ended November 2005 and November 2004, the firm securitized
$92.00 billion and $62.93 billion, respectively, of financial assets, including $65.18 billion and $47.46 billion,
respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities." The report also shows the value of their retained interests
in mortgage-backed securities as $2,928 and $1,798 billion, respectively, for those time periods. A back of the
envelope calculation suggests that (2.928-1.798)/62.93 = 1.73% was retained during this time period. This is
only a rough approximation, but it clearly shows that deal sponsors did retain at least a piece of these securities.
A similar computation using information from Merrill Lynch's annual reports gives an estimate of 2.84%.</mixed-citation>

Our inference is also robust to computing standard errors clustered at the sponsor level, and we present this in
robustness tests later. We recognize, however, that it is important to have a sufficiently large number of clusters to
obtain consistent standard errors using this method, and our sample has only twenty-six clusters. As an alternative
estimation technique, we estimate a seemingly unrelated regression model for the proportion of AAA, mezzanine,
and equity tranche in a deal (not tabulated). Our results are stronger for this specification.</mixed-citation>
