            <p>THE extensive reconditioning of parts that was practiced during the war will slowly be cut down as new parts again become plentiful. Then, Mr. Patras explains, the deciding factor will be cost. The rule as he practices it is: Recondition used parts wherever satisfactory service can be obtained from the reconditioned part and the cost of reconditioning is equal to or below the cost of a new part plus freight and handling. In addition the author suggested that improvements were particularly required in certain specific items, such as steering gears, oil seals, oil pumps, and oil pressure regulating valves. He explained further that if designers were to utilize to the greatest extent possible units and parts already in volume production, the inventory problems of the modern motor bus operators would be greatly simplified, and the cost of repair parts could be just that much less. The shortage of skilled mechanics is also discussed by Mr. Patras, who suggests that the fleet operator himself establish a comprehensive training program or assist in some form of cooperative effort along this direction.</p>
