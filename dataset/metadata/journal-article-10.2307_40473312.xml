         <abstract>
            <p>This paper examines whether a tightening of legal sanctions on insider trading via the implementation of the Insider Trading Sanctions Act (ITSA) in 1984 has affected the trading behavior of insiders where traders have the flexibility of trading on their private information over a long period of time to potentially obscure their trades from regulatory authorities. There is evidence to indicate that ITSA may not have had a deterrent effect on the trading behavior of insiders because insiders prosecuted for illegal trading generally do not suffer high penalties and typically only have to repay the profits earned on their trades (Meulbroek, 1992). We examine the trading behavior of corporate insiders before and after ITSA via exchange listings by NASDAQ firms. Exchange listings are events initiated by NASDAQ firms in consultation with exchange officials that are accompanied by significant positive abnormal returns before and at their announcement. This gives managers/insiders the incentive to purchase shares on personal account over a period of time when a decision on the listing application is pending. Given the imposition of substantial legal penalties after the passage of ITSA, we examine whether the behavior of insiders around the exchange listing event has changed significantly. We find that insiders continue to be net purchasers of their firm's stock around the listing event before and after the passage of ITSA. These findings differ from previous research on the effect of the passage of ITSA, where researchers have found that ITSA has had a deterrent effect on the trading behavior of insiders around events such as tender offers and seasoned equity offerings. We argue that these results cannot be generalized to events such as exchange listings where insiders have the ability to trade over a long period of time before the release of material information.</p>
