         <abstract>
            <p>The authors use studies in five Egyptian villages to identify potential niches in rural financial markets for a large agricultural bank. The studies collected information on both formal and informal finance and found that a surprisingly large variety of intermingled financial services are generally available to people living in these villages. The authors identify four major market niches for the Bank: deposit mobilization, non-farm rural businesses, providing financial services to women, and selling non-traditional services such as insurance, money transfers, and processing checks and other government payments in rural areas.</p>
