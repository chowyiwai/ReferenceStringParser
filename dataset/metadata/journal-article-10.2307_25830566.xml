         <abstract>
            <p>Recognizing that loan default is a serious problem in financial markets, this paper examined the credit rationing behavior of lenders and the repayment performance of borrowers at a rural financial institution. It is posited that some credit rationing criteria may promote access to credit, but they may also contribute to the poor repayment performance of borrowers. This paper therefore sought to isolate and make more transparent those criteria that led to lax lending strategies, separating them from other criteria that enhanced financial viability. Estimating a loan rationing equation and a repayment equation, using a random sample of loan applications and borrower information, it was revealed that only 33 percent of the criteria utilized identified creditworthy borrowers. Thus it was concluded that the technology was flawed and needed to be repaired. Results also indicated that tightening the loan contract terms by reducing the grace period on loans and rejecting applications which had long processing times enhanced the pool of creditworthy borrowers. It was also revealed that female borrowers were not rationed differently than male borrowers, nor were they worse re-payers than male borrowers. But evidence existed that wealthy borrowers were bad credit risks as their repayment performance was poor, while moral hazard problems existed whenever extended grace period on loans were contracted with borrowers.</p>
