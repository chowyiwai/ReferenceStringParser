         <abstract>
            <p>We examine how securitization markets affect the role of banks as monitors in corporate lending. We find that banks active in securitization impose looser covenants on borrowers at origination. After origination, these borrowers take on substantially more risk than do borrowers of non-securitization-active banks. We use borrowers' geographic locations to instrument for borrower-lender matching to distinguish the effect of securitization on the banks' ex post monitoring from its effect on ex ante screening. We further investigate direct evidence of banks' monitoring role by examining their actions following covenant violations and find that securitization-active lenders are more likely to grant waivers without changing loan terms. Our results suggest that banks exert less effort on ex post monitoring when they can securitize loans.</p>

If multiple lead arrangers are involved, we require all lead arrangers to be securitization active. In our sample,
43.6% of the loans have multiple lead arrangers. Our results are robust to the alternative classification that only
requires at least one of the lead arrangers to be securitization active.</mixed-citation>

DealScan records loan terms at the tranche (facility) level rather than at the loan (package) level. Because we are
most interested in Term Loan B, we report terms of this tranche in each loan (package). When the Term Loan B
tranche is missing in the data, we take the characteristics of other term loan tranches (e.g., Term Loan C, D, and
so on). To confirm whether Term Loan B is representative of all of the institutional tranches, we randomly draw
300 deals from our sample and manually check the characteristics of the institutional tranches for each deal.
We find that in over 95% of all cases, all of the institutional tranches in the same deal share common features,
including maturity, the presence of financial covenants, and primary loan purposes.</mixed-citation>

The mean covenant strictness in Murfin's sample is 22.51%. The higher probability of covenant violations in our

We recognize that loan covenants are jointly set with prices. The looser covenants we observe, however, are not
likely a result of the trade-off between covenant strictness and loan spreads. Nadauld and Weisbach (2012) find
that securitization leads to lower loan spreads in a similar sample of loans. Based on this finding, the trade-off
theory would predict stricter covenants for securitization-inclined loans, but we find the opposite.</mixed-citation>

The Securitization active dummy is not significant in these regressions, suggesting that it captures the effect of
securitization that is unique to the sample of leveraged loans. In addition, the Market CDO is not significant in
this table. This reassures us that although the expansion of the CDO market coincides with the economic boom
preceding the financial crisis of 2008-2009, Market CDO does not capture just the overall corporate risk taking

We collect information on the duration of waivers from borrowers' SEC filings. We read 10-Q and 10-K filings
for up to eight quarters following violations that were waived by lenders. We consider that a waiver is effective
until the quarter in which the borrower's financial ratios are in compliance with all covenants; this quarter then
marks the end of the waiver. In three cases, we still cannot verify such compliance by the end of the eighth
quarter following violation and therefore treat the eighth quarter as the end of the waiver.</mixed-citation>
