&lt;strong&gt;Protect your information assets with effective risk
management&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today's information economy, the development, exploitation
and protection of information and associated assets are key to the
long-term competitiveness and survival of corporations and entire
economies. The protection of information and associated assets -
information security - is therefore overtaking physical asset
protection as a fundamental corporate governance
responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Information security management system
requirements&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISO 27000, which provides an overview for the family of
international standards for information security, states that "An
organisation needs to undertake the following steps in
establishing, monitoring, maintaining and improving its ISMS […]
assess information security risks and treat information security
risks". The requirements for an ISMS are specified in ISO 27001.
Under this standard, a risk assessment must be carried out to
inform the selection of security controls, making risk assessment
the core competence of information security management and a
critical corporate discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Plan and carry out a risk assessment to protect your
information&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information Security Risk Management for ISO 27001 / ISO
27002&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides information security and risk management teams with
detailed, practical guidance on how to develop and implement a risk
assessment in line with the requirements of ISO 27001.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Draws on national and international best practice around risk
assessment, including BS 7799-3:2017 (BS 7799-3).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Covers key topics such as risk assessment methodologies, risk
management objectives, information security policy and scoping,
threats and vulnerabilities, risk treatment and selection of
controls.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Includes advice on choosing risk assessment software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideal for risk managers, information security managers, lead
implementers, compliance managers and consultants, as well as
providing useful background material for auditors, this book will
enable readers to develop an ISO 27001-compliant risk assessment
framework for their organisation and deliver real, bottom-line
business benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

                     <p>In this book we use the terms ‘method’ and ‘methodology’ interchangeably. A method is (as most standard dictionaries explain) simply a ‘way of doing something’. A method, in other words, will contain principles and procedures, describing both what must be done and how it must be done. A risk assessment methodology, therefore, is a description of the principles and procedures (preferably documented) that describe how information security risks should be assessed and evaluated.</p>

                     <p>This chapter will be of greater relevance to organisations pursuing an asset-based risk assessment methodology. While risks do not need to be assessed wholly on the basis of the assets that they threaten, it remains a popular and effective method of risk assessment. Furthermore, for organisations undertaking a scenario-based risk assessment, BS 7799-3 provides the following clarification of the role of asset management:</p>
                     <p>Using the scenario-based method does not mean that Annex A control A.8.1.1 is unnecessary. It just means that the asset inventory might not be an input into the risk assessment, whereas Annex A control A.8.1.1 might still</p>

                     <p>While asset-based risk assessment is a perfectly valid approach to risk assessment, it is not the only method, nor is it necessarily the best or the easiest. For some organisations, an asset-based risk assessment may be unnecessarily detailed, too time-consuming, or simply unfeasible for the specific risks that the organisation faces.</p>
                     <p>You should note, however, that BS 7799-3 does not favour one method over the other and, in fact, considers them fundamentally identical, stating:</p>
                     <p>An event is the action of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. […] The consequence is the result of the event […] which in the asset-threat-vulnerability method</p>

                     <p>Risk assessment involves identifying the potential business harm that might result from a risk coming to fruition. The way to do this is to assess the extent of the possible loss to the business for each potential concern. One object of this exercise is to prioritise treatment (controls) and to do so in the context of the organisation’s acceptable risk threshold, so it makes sense to categorise possible loss in terms of impact on the organisation of the risk occurring.</p>
                     <p>The successful exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat will have an impact on the asset’s confidentiality, integrity or availability.</p>

                     <p>Each of the preceding stages of the risk assessment has a relatively high degree of certainty about it. The vulnerabilities should be capable of technical, logical or physical identification. The way threats might exploit them should also be mechanically demonstrable. Defined scenarios have predictable consequences. The decisions that have to be made are those that relate to the actions the organisation will take to counter those threats. Before that, however, there needs to be an assessment as to the likelihood of the event, and what the appropriate response to it will be. This means that the actual risks have now</p>

                     <p>Risk level – the output of the risk equation that we discussed earlier – is a function of impact and likelihood (probability). The final step in the risk assessment exercise is to assess the risk level for each impact and to transfer the details to the corporate asset inventory.</p>
                     <p>Three levels of risk assessment are usually adequate: low, medium and high. Where the likely impact is low and the probability is also low, then the risk level could be considered very low.

                     <p>Once you have completed the risk assessment, you can move on to the selection of controls. This chapter reviews the requirements of ISO 27001 around control selection, which is also known as ‘risk treatment’.</p>
                     <p>As we said in chapter 1, there are four risk treatment decisions that can be made:</p>
                     <p>1. Avoid/reject the risk by deciding not to pursue the practices and/or arrangements that give rise to the risk.</p>
                     <p>2. Retain/take the risk, keeping it under review.</p>
                     <p>3. Modify/reduce risks to ‘acceptable’ levels through the application of controls.</p>
                     <p>4. Share the risk with another party, whether through contract or insurance.</p>

                     <p>Having conducted the risk assessment and taken decisions regarding the treatment of those assessed risks, the results need to be documented. This produces two documents:</p>

                     <p>The SoA lists all the controls the organisation has selected alongside a justification for their selection and whether or not they have been applied within the ISMS, and also identifies any controls from Annex A that have not been selected along with a justification for their exclusion.

                     <p>While the SoA identifies which of the ISO 27001 Annex A controls (and which, if any, additional controls) have been selected and the implementation status of each, it does not prioritise implementation or provide any guidance for how implementation is required to be carried out.</p>
                     <p>Of course, it would be logical for the organisation to tackle and implement controls in the order of priority (i.e. those that address ‘very high’ risks first). The controls that are most critical for the organisation will be those that relate to the threats and vulnerabilities that it has identified, through the risk assessment process,</p>

                     <p>Effective risk management is a continual cycle, which, as described earlier, might be in the mould of the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle or some other process model. This means, of course, that the risk assessment must be regularly revisited. ISO 27001 sets out the requirement very clearly, requiring management to “review the organization’s information security management system at planned intervals”, including considering “results of risk assessments and status of [the] risk treatment plan” (Clause 9.3).</p>
