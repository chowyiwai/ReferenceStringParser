         <abstract>
            <p>We empirically investigate whether reserve currency preferences have been a source of stability for the international monetary system. Our findings suggest that reserve-hoarding countries, especially the emerging/developing countries, tend to adopt a stabilizing diversification strategy in their reserve portfolio allocation, buying (selling) assets denominated in depreciated (appreciated) currency. The result is robust to both International Monetary Fund and Bank for International Settlements measures of quantity changes of reserve shares. The stabilizing diversification strategy reveals the fact that reserve-hoarding countries may fall into a "dollar trap," and escaping from it may cause more valuation loss of their existing reserve portfolios.</p>

At their first summit in 2010, Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) declared that they
would reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. To diversify their reserve portfolios away from dollar-
dominated assets, China and Brazil decided that they would invest $40 billion and $10 billion,
respectively, in IMF bonds denominated in SDRs, while India might reduce the dollar role in its
foreign exchange basket. Meanwhile, Russia has replaced the dollar with the euro as its basic reserve
currency and has shifted a proportion of its foreign exchange reserves into IMF bonds as well.</mixed-citation>

Papaioannou et al. (2006) also point out that a large reserve diversification away from the
U.S. dollar may trigger a crisis and cause great volatility in foreign exchange markets. So mon-
etary authorities with large amounts of reserves tend to rebalance their currencies. It should be
acknowledged that since the introduction of the euro the European Central Bank has almost never
intervened on the foreign exchange market.</mixed-citation>

Japan has similar concerns. After experiencing the "ten lost years" of stagnation, aging
of the population, and recent tsunami shocks, what Japan needs least is a strong yen. Regarding
the pound, Britain is still struggling in the global financial crises and its own fiscal problems. Its
economic size and share of world trades do not allow the pound to be a competitor to the dollar in
terms of being a reserve currency.</mixed-citation>

The logistic form = log (share/[ 1 - share]). Chinn and Frankel (2008) found that the function
form cannot be linear due to the value boundary of currency shares. After transforming by the logistic
function, the logistic of the currency share against the size variables becomes more linear.</mixed-citation>
