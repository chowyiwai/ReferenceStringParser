         <abstract>
            <p>A modified version of the three dimensional CFD code KTVA-3, which accommodates moving valves and a moving piston crown, has been applied to a heavy-duty, four cycle, dual intake valve, direct injection, diesel engine. The fluid domain encompasses an intake runner, two valved ports and a cylinder with a Mexican hat bowl-in-piston configuration. In the first part of the study, the modified KIVA-3 code was used to simulate the flow through the port and cylinder of the engine without a piston. The intake valves were cycled (300 rpm at the camshaft). Two turbulence models weie compared in this part of the study, standard k-ε and the RNG modified k-ε as discussed in [11]. The results were compared to particle image velocimetry (PIV) imagés. Large scale flow features of the computer simulations agreed moderately well with the ensemble averaged flow bench results. There was very little difference between the results from the two turbulence models. Motored engine simulations including a piston were conducted to characterize the in-cylinder gas flow and mixing during the intake and compression strokes. Characterization methods were developed which yield insight into the in-cylinder gas motion and mixing during both strokes. Intake and residual gases are tracked separately, both large scale convection and turbulent mixing are investigated, flow critical points are examined to provide information about flow topology and turbulence production is correlated with the evolution of flow structures. Results show that mixing of the intake and residual gases is very non-uniform. Many complex flow structures develop during intake and are destroyed during compression. However, several structures survive through compression and contribute to enhanced mixing near top dead center. These significant structures have been identified and tracked back to intake. The flow field near top dead center exhibits spatial inhomogeneities in temperature and small scale mixing parameters such as turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate.</p>
