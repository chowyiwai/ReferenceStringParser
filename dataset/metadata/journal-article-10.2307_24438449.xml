         <abstract>
            <p>This paper uses a simple model of how households at different points on the income distribution make decisions about saving and labour supply to illustrate some of the problems government faces in designing social security systems. We show simulation results, which highlight the costs and benefits of alternative pension and income support regimes, and analyse what is happening in the UK in the light of the results.</p>

in the late 1990s, the UK Labour Party politician Frank Field resigned from his role as the architect of the
government's pension reform strategy largely because he saw the system being steered by his government

In April 2002, the 'top-up' element of S2P was introduced. The transition to flat-rate benefits was originally
set to be in 2006-07, but this date was dropped in the 2002 Green Paper on pensions (Department for Work
and Pensions, 2002) pending further consultation.</mixed-citation>

We assume taxes are paid on after-saving income. This does not reflect the actual tax system in the UK. There
are tax breaks on saving in the UK and much saving is made out of pre-tax income. But it is a simplification to
assume all saving is tax-advantaged. In Section VII, where we use a more realistic and complicated model, we
drop this assumption.</mixed-citation>

We will consistently describe the levels of state pensions and of income support as the maximum level of
benefits relative to the income of a typical worker, who we take to be a worker with average productivity who
supplies 30 per cent of time to paid work. When we talk about the replacement rate of the pension system, we
are referring to this ratio.</mixed-citation>

The reason for paying attention to the median earner is that they are the voter to whom a party looking to get
the most support for their proposals on social security would pay a great deal of attention. (For an extended

If there were no loss in effective units of time at retirement, individuals would consume less in retirement
simply because they have been forced to consume leisure. The empirical evidence is mixed on whether this
substitution effect can be observed; see, for example, Blundell, Banks and Tanner (1998). We therefore chose
to adjust the utility function to compensate.</mixed-citation>
