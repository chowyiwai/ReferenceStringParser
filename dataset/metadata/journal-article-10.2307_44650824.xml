         <abstract>
            <p>This paper discusses one method for reducing heavyduty truck rollover accidents, the Freightliner/MeritorWABCO Roll Advisor and Control (RA&amp;C) System. It describes the operation of this system and the unique way in which RA&amp;C trains drivers to avoid highrisk rollover and braking conditions. In addition, the rationale for this approach is discussed in terms of Behavioral Based Safety (BBS), and the means employed to communicate with drivers is described. A technical description of the RA&amp;C system is presented including a discussion of the challenges of designing and developing this product to be a cost-effective system readily implemented in today's commercial vehicles. Resolution of these challenges leads to the choice of the ABS platform to house and operate the necessary electronics and software along with the Freightliner Driver Message Center for displaying driver information. To maximize reliability and keep installation as simple as possible, all external sensors were eliminated and the existing vehicle data busses were employed to transfer all required information. As a BBS system, RA&amp;C presents timely performance feedback to help the driver to reduce the incidence of rollover risk and hard braking events. The design of the interface employed the Freightliner Driver Message Center platform and was guided by the implementation of human factors principles and driver testing. Several methods are used to communicate the degree of rollover risk. Driving advisories are provided as guidance for avoiding future rollover risk situations. In addition, a method that allows drivers to monitor driving performance through access to cumulative rollover risk and hard braking event message counts is discussed.</p>
