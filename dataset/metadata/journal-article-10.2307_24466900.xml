         <abstract>
            <p>We develop a 10-K-based multidimensional measure of firm locations. Using this measure, we show that firm-level information is geographically distributed and institutional investors are able to exploit the resulting information asymmetry. Specifically, institutional investors overweigh firms whose 10-K frequently mentions the investors' state even when those firms are not headquartered locally and earn superior returns on those stocks. These ownership and performance patterns are stronger among hard-to-value firms. Local investor performance increases with the degree of local bias and with the local economic exposure of portfolio firms. Overall, geographical variation in firm-level information generates economically significant location-based information asymmetry.</p>

For example, although Boeing Co. is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, most of its operations are in the state
of Washington. Similarly, Whole Foods Market is headquartered in Austin, Texas, but has a large number of
stores and significant exposure in other states - for example, Massachusetts, Florida, and Colorado. Xerox Corp.,
which many perceive as a Rochester, New York company because of its large local presence, is headquartered
in Stamford, Connecticut.</mixed-citation>

Whereas our study focuses on the multidimensional nature of firm location, recent studies by Pool, Stoffman, and
Yonker (2012) and Shu, Sulaeman, and Yeung (2012) examine the multidimensional nature of investor location
and find that an investor's portfolio decisions are related to the location at which she was born and/or went to
college, in addition to that at which she is currently employed.</mixed-citation>

Although we refer to annual reports as 10-K forms throughout the paper, we collect and employ data from three
types of forms: 10-K, 10-KSB, or 20-F. The latter two forms correspond to small businesses and foreign issuers,

Our parsing algorithm would miss instances in which the 10-K filing mentions a city but not the state. We also
would be unable to capture cases in which the 10-K filings use state abbreviations. Inspection of a randomly
selected set of filings indicates that both cases are rare. Further, there is no reason to believe that certain types
of firms or firms located in certain states are more likely to abbreviate states or mention only city names in their
reports. Thus, the citation counts may be noisy, but the relative frequency measure across firms would not exhibit
a systematic bias due to these exclusions.</mixed-citation>

Although this approach may be too conservative for firms that significantly change their exposure across states
from one year to the next, the firm-state citation share and citation share rankings are quite persistent, as previously
discussed. To be conservative, we use potentially stale location data, which in principle should work against
finding significant results.</mixed-citation>

For the reasons explained at the end of Section 4, we shift our focus from the full set of cited states, as in Tables
4 through 6, to the top three non-HQ cited states, in Table 7 onwards. In previous versions of this paper, we used

In unreported analysis, we find that there is similar evidence of local bias in various subsamples of institutions
defined using investor self-reported types or portfolio sizes. Our finding that large institutions have weaker local
bias is consistent with previous evidence obtained using different samples, for example, mutual funds during an
earlier period in Coval and Moskowitz (2001).</mixed-citation>

This performance measure is identical to the "Portfolio Change Measure" introduced by Grinblatt and Titman
(1993) and referred to as the GT measure by Daniel et al. (1997). More precisely, the trading performance is
calculated as the difference between the performance of the investor portfolio as reported at the end of the
previous quarter and that of the investor portfolio as reported at the beginning of the previous quarter. Because
the returns from the part of the portfolio that does not change over the quarter cancel out, the measured trading
performance is solely attributed to the part of the portfolio that changes during the previous quarter.</mixed-citation>

The reduction in local HQ performance over time is consistent with the trend observed by Coval and Moskowitz
(2001), in which the performance differential between local and nonlocal mutual fund holdings is not significant
in the second half of their sample period (1985 to 1994), both statistically (r-statistic = 0.09) and economically
(annualized performance differential = 0.04%). Sulaeman (2014) extends this analysis to 2005 and reports
similar patterns. Bernile, Kumar, and Sulaeman (2014) report that the decline in HQ performance coincide with
the reduction in local HQ bias of institutional investors.</mixed-citation>
