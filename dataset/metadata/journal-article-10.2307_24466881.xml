            <p>Home Equity Conversion Mortgages ("HECMs") implicitly bundle nondefaultable credit lines with put options that let borrowers, or their heirs, sell mortgaged homes for the credit line limit when borrowers move or die. The put option's value, net of closing costs, bounds HECM's value to borrowers below. Older homeowners' weak demand is commonly attributed to HECM's "high costs," and the government prices insurance intending to avoid subsidy. However, simulations indicate put value has often exceeded closing costs, even ignoring other embedded options and using backward-looking expectations near the recent price-cycle peak. These results make weak demand more puzzling.</p>

Venti and Wise (2001) among others document the importance of home equity in retiree portfolios. Bayer and
Harper (2000) presents survey evidence that most retirees are strongly averse to moving out of their homes.
Building on the theoretical foundation in Artie and Varaiya (1978), Mayer and Simons (1994) estimate that a
very large number of retired homeowners are sufficiently house rich and cash poor that a reverse mortgage would
provide significant benefits. Market potential in other countries has been explored by Deng and Ma (2013) and
Mitchell and Piggott (2005), among others.</mixed-citation>

Fewer than 20% of U.S. homeowners over age 75 in the 2007-2010 American Community Survey owe any
mortgage debt. Tabulations of Health and Retirement Study (HRS/AHEAD) data show that among individuals
between 65 and 70 years old who owned a home with no mortgage debt in 1998 or 2000, and who owned a home
in 2010, fewer than 9% owed any mortgage debt in 2010; among those 75 to 80, fewer than 7% owed mortgage

Shiller and Weiss (2000) and Miceli and Sirmans (1994) note maintenance may decline when the put option is
likely to terminate in the money, and Capone, Chang, and Cushman (2010) find evidence that HECM borrowers
do less maintenance than other homeowners do. Davidoff and Welke (2006) find that HECM terminations are
highly procyclical, which likely augments net put-option value, holding mean terminations constant.</mixed-citation>

There are other differences in modeling that may affect put-option value. First, NT's parameterization of utility
appears to generate large response of home sales to anticipated price volatility and expected price declines. If
potential borrowers sell their homes upon news that price declines are imminent, then the put option has little
value, because it does not have enough time to come into the money. Second, unlike this article, NT consider the
option of waiting to use HECM (and spend closing costs) until more information concerning liquidity demand
and available proceeds from HECM is revealed. NT may overstate the benefit of waiting by assuming the need
to dispose of financial assets at closing. The benefit of waiting may also be attenuated in reality by HECM's
discounts to insurance premiums for refinance, which both NT and this article ignore. A third difference, NT's
explicit modeling of bequest and precautionary motives, would likely increase put-option value to borrowers.</mixed-citation>

Whether heirs can retain the home by paying off the appraised value, as opposed to the loan amount, is an area

The fact that borrowers, who must go through credit counseling, apparently do not ask counselors about short-
sale consequences may be evidence that they do not have strategic use of limited liability in mind. For potential
borrowers with low incomes, available nonmortgage credit is likely to be minimal, so that both the opportunity
cost of any damage to credit and the probability that credit damage would affect entry into a nursing home are
likely quite small. Borrowers may live in a nursing facility for at least 12 months before the lender can accelerate
the debt, and Jones (2002) finds that over 80% of nursing-home stays are shorter than 12 months.</mixed-citation>

See Davidoff and Welke (2006). Assuming expected price growth is less than the loan interest rate, remaining
in the home when the put option is in the money increases expected put option value. Empirically, many of
the excess terminations that have occurred when home values have grown faster than credit lines have been
(relatively underpriced) refinances into larger HECMs.</mixed-citation>

Required repairs that the homeowner would otherwise not do, and deviations of homeowners' insurance from fair
pricing are costs of HECM to risk-neutral borrowers relative to no HECM loan. The requirement that borrowers
pay property taxes is likely not a cost of HECM absent mortgage debt. Borrowers would presumably have
difficulty avoiding property taxes long enough for the tax lien to exceed property value.</mixed-citation>

In reality, Case-Shiller local home-price index futures are not liquid even at short horizons; Real Estate Investment
Trusts (REITs) or home builder shares might approximate the underlying collateral but would introduce stock
market risk. A portfolio of hedging position offsetting the puts value at each possible T would themselves only
be offset by a realized put at one T. Without (a) or (b), trades in a price index and bonds might be able to hedge
the expectation of put value across termination dates without risk, but not the realization.</mixed-citation>

Sinai and Souleles (2005) and Sinai and Souleles (2013) provide evidence consistent with hedging demand on
the part of younger households (although weaker demand among older households). Standard models of bequests
echoed in NT, such as De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010), do not have home prices in the bequest function.
Heirs' housing consumption is also likely hedged through uninsured labor income. Shiller (1993) and Caplin and
others (1997) suggest that there should be strong demand for short positions in prices among homeowners.</mixed-citation>

The relationships between nursing home expenditures and longevity (Webb, 2009) and the marginal utility of
wealth themselves are not well understood. Consumption externalities (Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo,
2013) and Medicaid (Brown and Finkelstein, 2007) cloud the relationship between marginal utility and nursing
home expenditures. If long-term care is a very high marginal utility state of the world, then absence of demand for
long-term care insurance is difficult to rationalize (Lockwood, 2013, Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Yogo, 2014).
Home equity illiquidity may rationalize both absence of demand for annuities and long-term care insurance, so
whether these products would be more commonly held with a HECM in place is difficult to know (Davidoff,
2009).</mixed-citation>

Most older homeowners express a desire to avoid selling and moving out of their homes, per Bayer and Harper
(2000), and there are institutional barriers to taking on home-equity debt in retirement (see Shan (2011) and NT).
However, these alternatives may be particularly attractive to those otherwise likeliest to use HECM. Among
those for whom HECM offers a favorably priced put, selling is a more plausible substitute for the put option for
those anticipating short-run price declines, rather than stable but weak price appreciation. Coile and Davidoff
(2013) find that while home sales among older owners were procyclical during the home-price boom and bust,
there was not a quantitatively large jump in home sales among older homeowners in the Sand States.</mixed-citation>
