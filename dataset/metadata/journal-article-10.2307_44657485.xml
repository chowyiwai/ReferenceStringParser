         <abstract>
            <p>The NHTSA has developed automotive recorders which can measure crash triaxial acceleration/time histories during vehicle collisions. From these a c celeration histories (recorded on a magnetic disc), velocity/time histories and velocity change during impact are derived to provide measures of vehicle crash severity. The purpose of developing these recorders is to provide accurate and quantitative relationships of vehicle crash severity with occupant fatalities and serious injuries from real-world a c cidents. To date, a total of 1200 disc recorders has been produced, approximately 1050 recorders have been installed in fleet vehicles, and 23 accident records have been analyzed. This paper has been prepared to present the progress made in the Disc Recorder Pilot Project as of March 31, 1974. Recorder data from accidents involving vehicles equipped with disc recorders will be discussed and compared with associated reports by accident investigators. Also, crash tests to which the disc recorders have been subjected will be described along with an evaluation of results. Because of the recorder accuracy confirmed by these tests under different speeds and conditions, we are fully confident that the disc recorders are valid instruments for measuring vehicle crash severity.</p>
