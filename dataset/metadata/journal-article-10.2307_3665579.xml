         <abstract>
            <p>After remaining stable for the period 1980 to 1985, global foreign direct investment dramatically increased in 1986 and subsequent years. The rise continued, peaked in 1990, and then declined. In the 1970s and early 1980s, most foreign acquirers of U.S. assets were from the UK, Canada, and the Netherlands. By 1987, Japanese investors owned or controlled more U.S. assets than did any other class of foreign investors. Did these acquisitions by Japanese firms result in gains for U.S. selling firm stockholders and for the Japanese buyers? Is the market for these cross-border acquisitions fully competitive so that all the gains accrue to the sellers? Are there imperfections or asymmetries in global capital markets that allow Japanese buyers to gain significant wealth from these acquisitions? What factors explain the trends in foreign direct investment from Japan? Were the trends associated with differences in exchange rates? How plausible are the more traditional explanations of acquisitions (such as the medium of exchange used in the purchase, relative size of buyers and sellers, and diversification advantages) in explaining wealth impacts on both Japanese buyers and U.S. sellers. The purpose of this paper is to answer these questions. We measure the wealth effects of Japanese cross-border mergers and unit purchases and attempt to explain the sources of these effects. The analysis of the impacts of Japanese acquisition announcements upon shareholder wealth indicates that both the Japanese buyers and U.S. sellers gain significant wealth from these cross-border mergers and unit acquisitions. It appears that these cross-border acquisitions are not made in a perfectly competitive market, as not all the gains from these combinations accrue to the U.S. sellers. Previous studies of cross-border acquisitions have focused only on the U.S. sellers, assuming that the market was competitive; thus, our results are new and noteworthy. These effects are consistent with the existence of imperfections and cost advantages in product and factor markets and/or imperfections and asymmetries in global capital markets that allow the Japanese buyers of U.S. assets to gain significant wealth upon the announcement of acquisitions. Separate comparisons of announcement period changes in stockholder wealth of Japanese buyers and U.S. sellers reveal that the wealth gains are larger for sellers than buyers. Wealth gains to Japanese buyers in mergers are higher when the medium of exchange is all cash and large when the firm diversifies. The gains to U.S. sellers are smaller when the buyer is large relative to the seller and higher for mergers than unit sales. In conclusion, both the shareholders of the buyers and the shareholders of the sellers for mergers and divested units gain significant wealth from these cross-border investments. The gains to the U.S. sellers are significantly larger than to buyers, but the Japanese buyers also gain significant wealth from both mergers and unit purchases. Thus, these cross-border investments between Japan and the U.S. are wealth-enhancing activities for the stockholders of both groups. Several implications can be drawn from this study. First, the assumption that the market for cross-border acquisitions is competitive with all the gains accruing to the seller is not valid in the case of Japanese acquisitions. Thus, the results from this paper are consistent with the suggestions that there are information imperfections in the globally integrated capital markets. Second, this study finds support for the suggestion that direct foreign investment could be driven by imperfections and cost differentials in the product and factor markets, as well as imperfections and asymmetries in global capital markets. Even though the specific factors driving these gains are not completely known, this paper finds that the magnitude of the gains depends more on the relative market power among the buyers and sellers and on the nature of the assets being purchased, rather than on variation in exchange rates. Finally, these results are applicable over the period October 1981 through September 1991 during which time Japanese direct investment first rose dramatically and then declined. In fact, Japanese direct investment in the U.S. has followed the trend of global foreign direct investment, which peaked in 1990. Many Japanese businessmen currently believe that their investments in the U.S. have yielded less than the expected returns. However, even if the long-term performance of these acquisitions shows that, ex post, the initial price paid was too high, the results of this study clearly indicate that there were positive expectations at the time of the acquisition announcement and a corresponding wealth gain for the shareholders.</p>
