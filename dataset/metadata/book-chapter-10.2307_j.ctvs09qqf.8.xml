      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>As digital transformations continue to accelerate in the world, discourses of big data have come to dominate in a number of fields, from politics and economics, to media and education. But how can we really understand the digital world when so much of the writing through which we grapple with it remains deeply problematic? In a compelling new work of feminist critical theory, Bassett, Kember and O'Riordan scrutinise many of the assumptions of a masculinist digital world, highlighting the tendency of digital humanities scholarship to venerate and essentialise technical forms, and to adopt gendered writing and citation practices. Contesting these writings, practices and politics, the authors foreground feminist traditions and contributions to the field, offering alternative modes of knowledge production, and a radically different, poetic writing style. Through this prism, Furious brings into focus themes including the automation of home and domestic work, the Anthropocene, and intersectional feminist technofutures.</p>

                     <p>This is a metrical book in one long and, in any order, three shorter chapters: a four-syllable metrical foot in prosody. Thus, a paeon, of a kind, about the digital or post-digital; we don’t care which. One is shorthand for a formation it does not describe. The second labels a change within that formation we do not necessarily accept. This is a form of poetic writing that wants to grapple with our contemporary constellation. This is not a book about labels.</p>
                     <p>This constellation, from our point of view, orbits around the attractions of big data, of computable everything, of smart</p>

In the new technological realism, new fantasies arise; promises of precision editing and recombining at the level of the organism. Genomes carry much of this, and futures are imagined in which genome sequences are the media of future lives, of preserved species and post-humans, aiding de-extinction, genetic engineering and cryogenics alike. They emerged as promissory things, big data, biomedical hope and hype in the 1990s and onwards. Currently genome projects refer to the existence of hundreds of thousands of genomes. Genome projects have scaled from one to many, from the one</p>

                     <p>Here is a woman wearing an oven (Figure 1); Birgit Jürgenssen photographed herself as a housewife needing to get out of domestic constraints (‘<italic>Ich möchte hier raus!</italic>’, Figure 2). You start out with your head in his arms and end up remade as his cooker. The photograph dramatizes what was not then unusual: women cooking in 1970s homes. What’s striking now is that this is a portrait of augmentation. The oven constitutes Jürgenssen’s outskirts, her outer bounds; she is technologically extended. Apron was part of a retrospective exhibition of feminist avant-garde works of the 1970s, displayed at the Photographers Gallery</p>

                     <p>We’ve evoked Hélène Cixous’ writing, and collaborative writing as a project against writing. She writes to us what language does. Finding herself stuck between a rock and a hard place, the abyss and the Medusa, cries: ‘ Let’s get out of here!’</p>
                     <p>Her stuckness is that of a political subject, an emergent political subject, a female, feminist subject whose coming to being is contingent on escaping, or even destroying, the phallocentric social and linguistic structures that trap her.</p>

There is the cloud that is at once the abstract architectures, data flows and physical substrates of an information system that mediates everything we do. There are the weather clouds that may signal environmental damage or bring rain. And we know that these systems are not separate from our activities: the earth is clouded by human actions. Then there is the cloud that is injustice – that says prosperity is experienced unequally both in terms of what it provides and what it damages, and that not only prosperity but freedom is systematically refused to</p>
