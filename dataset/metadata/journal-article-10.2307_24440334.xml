         <abstract>
            <p>The UK has recently experienced its deepest recession since the Second World War. One feature has been the resilience of employment, which fell far less than GDP. This led to a substantial fall in labour productivity and has given rise to a so-called 'productivity puzzle'. In this paper, we use firm- and individual-level data to shed new light on these aggregate patterns and we examine changes in firm investment in physical capital and profitability. We provide evidence that labour productivity, investment and firm profitability all fell, on average, within firms over the course of the recession and that many of these adjustments were more pronounced in small firms. We also provide indicative evidence on the extent to which different firms might have engaged in labour 'hoarding'. Our results provide new insight into the potential determinants of the productivity puzzle and also indicate the types of firms that might be expected to be able to respond more quickly to a subsequent increase in demand.</p>

A reporting unit is the most disaggregated level at which we observe information such as labour costs
and investment. This is the level at which businesses choose to respond to the survey. Most businesses
report at a whole-enterprise level. But larger and more complex enterprises may have multiple reporting
units. For example, in 2009, 259 out of 41,559 enterprises (0.6 per cent) in our sample have multiple
reporting units. For simplicity, we use the term 'firm' interchangeably with the term 'reporting unit' in
this paper.</mixed-citation>

For industry, we use one-digit SIC. For enterprise size, we use three bands: small (fewer than 50
employees), medium (50 to 249 employees) and large (250 or more employees). While it is possible in
principle to link the two data sets directly using enterprise-level identifiers, in practice the resultant
sample sizes are too small to produce robust analysis.</mixed-citation>

We exclude those whose reported weekly hours are greater than 100 or whose reported hourly
earnings are more than Â£1,000. The percentage of observations whose pay was affected by absence was
just under 10 per cent every year until 2004 and about 5 per cent every year onwards, despite there being
no change to the question. We therefore include an indicator for a sample break occurring in 2005 in our
analysis using the ASHE data. See Section II.2 for details.</mixed-citation>

Note that because the ASHE data are recorded in April each year and refer largely to the preceding
financial year, information reported in April 2009 covers two-thirds of 2008 as well. It is for this reason

It appears that this jump in average hours between 2004 and 2005 is caused by the exclusion of
employees whose pay was affected by absence, who tend to have lower hours. If such observations were

The average growth rate of real hourly wages remained slightly above zero in 2010 and 2011
